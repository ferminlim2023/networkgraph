During the trip, students will visit companies and interact with executives and entrepreneurs. They will also be exposed to the country's history, culture, traditions, and values as these play an important role in determining business and financial strategies and operations of companies. 

At the same time, this is an SMU-XO module, which offers an overseas experiential learning opportunity for students. The course allows students to translate classroom knowledge and theory into practical solutions for real organizations. In addition to visits to companies and organizations, student will also participate in a consultancy project. Through the project, students will learn how to solve real  problems with guidance from the faculty and project sponsor mentors, from problem definition to final client presentation – while simultaneously testing their skills in real world settings. The project will focus on issues related to sustainability accounting that is faced by the accounting/finance and other functions of the companies in the country that will be visited and recommending/applying solutions to these problems. These issues (eg: implementation of sustainability reporting) are becoming very important for companies all around the world.

ACCT.414,SOA,Accounting Analytics Capstone,"Traditionally, the accounting function's role is always viewed as that of a steward, the control centre for the organisation, rather than the catalyst for enterprise growth. The term 'back office' is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today's volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. 

With complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into 'intelligent accounting functions'. 

Intelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.

This accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.","Financial Analysis, Internal Controls, Data Analytics, Data Storytelling and Visualisation, Programming and Coding","Multidisciplinary Knowledge, Interdisciplinary Knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Self-directed learning, Resilience",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Accounting Data and Analytics Core, AREA - Accounting Electives, AREA - Accounting Options, AREA - Advanced Business Technology Major, AREA - Analytics Major, AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Grad Req - Dig Tech/Data Ana (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - IS Related Courses, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Technology & Entrepreneurship, RQCP - ACCT337/ANLY104/IS217, RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only, TRCK - Accounting Major: Data Analytics Track, TRCK - Analytics Major: Accounting Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=ACCT.414,,,

This special topic on Arts Entrepreneurship and Creative Economies was chosen because the arts today must be equipped to deal with the radical socio-economic and environmental changes that we are living through, from evolving audience behaviours to the relentless pressures of inflation and a boundless array of inequities. Additionally, arts organisations can no longer rely on pre-pandemic business models to sustain their survival, relevance and influence.

This topic will focus on enabling students to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset to identify, frame and shape the developments, challenges and opportunities facing the cultural and creative industries today and in the near future. They will acquire conceptual and practical skills to address these challenges using a cultural economics approach and cultural value perspective, particularly within a Singapore context. 

Upon completion, students will better understand: (1) the dynamic development and competition of the arts as exceptional and creative economies in Singapore, (2) the ambidexterity required to support the creation of conducive conditions to develop works of art, creative goods and services, and (3) how to develop evidence-based insights and value-based strategies from existing empirical case studies and ventures.

How can I tell when someone is trying to deceive me? Why are some people especially susceptible to persuasive attempts?  How do mass influence conditions, like public policy campaigns, differ from how one gains compliance from individuals?

COMM230,LKCSB,The Art of Pitching: Conveying Your Ideas Persuasively and Engagingly,"Steve Jobs, a master at pitching, once said, ""The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."" Successful pitching, whether to investors, superiors, or other decision makers, involves a healthy mix of ""crazy belief"", confidence and risk-taking. For this reason, pitching can be both incredibly terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. 

Understanding the fundamentals as well as the mechanics of pitching will take you far towards successfully pitching your ideas. And there's nothing like good, old-fashioned practice with plenty of feedback from peers and experts to help you hone your pitching skills. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals and mechanics of effective pitches and put into practice everything we are learning week by week towards becoming successful pitchers. 

While many people think of pitching as only useful for those who need to raise money (for example, a start-up pitch), pitching is actually an essential skill for reaching agreement on almost any subject. Agreement can yield many outcomes: management buy-in for developing a product or service, closing a sale, securing a partnership, recruiting an employee, securing an investment, and even securing employment for yourself. 

Nancy Duarte, a communication specialist, put it this way: ""Companies are started, products are launched, climate systems are saved – possibly based on the quality of presentations. Likewise, ideas, endeavours, and even careers can be cut short due to ineffective communication."" In this course, you will be given a good foundation for successful pitching so that no worthy idea or endeavour of yours will fall short simply because it wasn't effectively conveyed.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Communication Management Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Innovation & Entrepreneurship Major Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COMM230,,,
COMM245,LKCSB,Internal Communication,"To achieve anything substantial at work, it is essential, if not necessary to amass support from internal stakeholders – to communicate and persuade colleagues to understand, accept and support ideas. Yet, most communication efforts in organisations tend to be directed externally. Internal communication is often misunderstood and is generally assumed as unnecessary as employees are expected to accept and comply. Recognising the importance of internal communication begins with the acknowledgement that organisations comprise sentient, thinking and diverse individuals who might not be readily agreeable and invariably obliging. Internal communication is fundamental as it can enable organisations to align missions and goals, cultivate common beliefs, coordinate activities, develop a shared identity and facilitate decision-making. Through project work with an external partner organisation and a variety of experiential in-class activities, this SMU-X course invites students to synthesise theories, frameworks and best practices from industry to address real-life business challenges affected by internal communication.","Content Strategy, Organisational Relationship Building, Customer Behaviour Analysis, Business Presentation Delivery, Stakeholder Management","Interdisciplinary knowledge, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Communication Management Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COMM245,,,
COMM246,LKCSB,Crisis Management and Communication,"Organizations are battling crises of some form or other every day. This can be internal crises like organizational miscommunication, personality clashes; or external crises, for instance, arising from policy mismanagement to terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises. Even as we speak, we have just emerged from a global crisis, Covid-19, that has engulfed the world. 
 
This course equips students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises. 
 
As leaders of the future, it is important to understand how crises can impact the organization. It is a useful course for students of all disciplines: Some of you will be leading crisis management and communication in your roles as domain experts in the respective fields or as organizational leaders, others may become consultants or communication professionals who work with C-suites to navigate through crises.

When leaders master this critical skill, they are able to unlock the secrets of employee engagement. Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric and business consultant, even lists employee engagement as the number one measure of a company's health.

In this hands-on and practical course, you will be taught frameworks for enhancing employee communication. This course explores the power of engaging employees, and the tools and tactics required to create an inspired and connected employee community for driving a successful organizational strategy. You will comprehend how to establish a clear line-of-sight between employee contributions and organizational success. You will also learn how to create trust and build personal connections, discover the elements of successful leadership, and be exposed to frameworks that will provide guidance as to how to develop an impactful and results-driven communication strategy, and gain exposure to practical examples as well as learn from cases. 

As you go through this process of learning, you will understand what it means to be an engaged employee. You will learn how to use participatory, collaborative and strategic tools to influence management approaches to employee communication. Before you become a leader, and even when you are a leader, you are first and foremost an employee. Since communication is a two-way process, both the leader and the employee need to comprehend the rules of engagement – this is what the course will impart – a toolkit for effective employee communication in today's project-centered, matrixed, or virtual organizations.

To hone your learning, you will be asked to practice what you learn by participating in a capstone project in which you will develop an employee communication plan for an assigned company.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives/IS Options, AREA - Corporate Communication / Communication Management, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COMM247,,,
COMM250,LKCSB,Change Communication: A Leadership Instrument for Transforming Organisations,"If management is like slaying monsters, change management compares to fighting monstrous hordes. Firstly,  because the specific change situation is often unique and therefore outside management´s comfort zone. Secondly, because change can only be successful if all stakeholders (investors, employees, media etc.) support the process. Change operations fail often enough and become crises. Therefore true change leaders are also true communicators (or get their advice) – involving and persuading multiple and often conflicting stakeholder groups. Since change has become commonplace in business, change communication is today a pivotal function of leadership.

This course will show how strategies that may hold intuitive appeal can be challenged and better informed by psychological principles underlying human judgment and decision-making. Students will learn the key psychological principles about how people process information in a given context and how to assess the conditions under which intended and/or unintended consequences arise. The learning, in turn, can be transformed to exert a competitive edge by identifying contributing and constraining factors of strategic communication to make an impact.","User Experience Design, Customer Behaviour Analysis, Design Thinking Practice","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Ethics and social responsibility, Understanding of Sustainability Issues",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Communication Management Core, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COMM302,COMM301,,

COR-ACM2624,SOSS,"Art History: Modern, Postmodern, and Contemporary","In the Western world of the mid-19th century, change was everywhere. Industry boomed, and the pace of life increased, leading to relentless urbanisation and a boost in mobility and communications. Travelling and the notion of taking a holiday were growing in popularity and a 'culture of things' primed consumerism as an expression of social status. While the abolition of slavery had begun, nationalism exploded in a Europe where Imperialism brought large parts of Asia and Africa under colonial rule and introduced new interactions, dependencies, and exploitations. 

Artists strove to find new ways of encapsulating this complex world through their creations. With the advent of photography and film, and new building and artistic techniques, some of the most exciting changes in art history took place. This period gave us creative universes as diverse as Monet's open-air impressions, Renoir's zest for life, Toulouse Lautrec's underground worlds, and Van Gogh's anguish. 

Throughout the 20th century, new sets of media and art forms appeared, and the social structure of the art world consolidated. New construction materials were used, artistic techniques developed, and a multitude of isms (Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, etc.) challenged previous conventions. Artists supported and even championed the advancement of social causes. They were often at the forefront of protest movements against wars and injustices and denouncing discrimination by race, gender and sexual orientation. Today, contemporary art simultaneously experiences greater accessibility and democratisation. At the same time, it also suffers an increasing level of commodification and continues to evolve as it finds new ways to innovate, inspire, and provoke its audiences. 

This course examines crucial works of art from the nineteenth century to the contemporary. It provides students with a roadmap to reflect on them in an open-minded, critical and analytical way. It considers historical, economic and socio-political contexts, and focuses on the integration of art within the broader cultural environment.

We start by exploring the fundamentals of digital media: its key players, growth, regulatory challenges, and governance approaches. Then we delve into key concerns about the creation and consumption of digital content. Some questions we will try to answer are:
•	Are we doing enough to protect Internet users from the growing range of online harms?
•	How do we hold anonymous threat actors accountable for objectionable online conduct?
•	Is there room for cancel culture in online discourse? Should we legislate against it?
•	How far should censorship extent now that so much content is so widely accessible from so many information streams?
•	Should we actively regulate generative AI at the risk of stifling innovation and growth?
•	Do individuals like you and I have a right to our own image in cyberspace?
•	What should legal and regulatory issues should content creators and online platforms be concerned about when doing business?
This course balances policy and practice. On a conceptual level, we will study regulatory challenges, approaches, regimes, and gaps.

More than that, constitutions express a state's identity and provide the framework for all other laws and policies. This course will expose students to the challenges attendant on making constitutions work. At the same time, it will sensitise them to the extent to which the wider social, political and economic context and a country's underlying culture affect the implementation of constitutional rules and values. Evergreens like the separation of powers, constitutional enforcement and dilemmas in ensuring equality and dignity will be explored through comparative study of experiences in a diverse range of jurisdictions. Instead of exploring models and constitutional solutions in the abstract, the course invites students to explore the practical impact and outcomes particular constitutional models and ideas produce in everyday life. To that end, we will amongst others compare the constitutional responses that different countries provide to contemporary challenges such as how to ensure effective public participation in governance without encouraging populism; the pervasiveness of migration for our understanding of citizenship and its entitlements; ensuring that everyone is treated equally while respecting individual autonomy and life choices; the role of technology in public life and the implications for privacy and free speech; and the role of a constitution in fostering economic development.","Regulatory Compliance, Legal Drafting and Writing","Multidisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Collaboration and leadership, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Asia Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Communities - Cultures of the Modern World, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - General Education, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR-LAW2610,,,
COR-LAW2612,YPHSL,Jurisprudence: Modern and Critical Theories of Law,"What is law? How is law related to justice? This course enables law students to step back to reflect upon what they have learnt in law school thus far by engaging philosophical concepts of law and justice through studying selected representative works of jurisprudence. Non-law students who are interested in philosophy or in thinking about law's nature and its role in society will also have the opportunity to study these ideas as expounded by famous legal philosophers. 

We will consider accounts of law offered by several legal positivists and modern natural law theorists, and challenges posed by alternative critical accounts. How do modern and critical accounts of law shape our thinking about the nature and purpose of law? How does adopting a particular account of law impact the practice of law? How can we, as lawyers or citizenry, harness law's potential as a tool for transforming society?

Through this course, students will have a unique opportunity to engage their hearts and minds in relation to the concepts of law and justice. Students will also be encouraged to relate the theories studied to current contexts (e.g. laws that restrict personal liberty, unjust laws, how judges decide cases, and so on). The course's focus is on critique of ideas and not mere description of doctrine. The methods of assessment will be intentionally geared towards facilitating critical thought. This course encourages students to formulate their own theses about law and justice, and meaningfully understand their purpose in the legal process.

This course also offers law students a chance to study selected representative texts in jurisprudence in greater detail than in the law core module, Legal Theory & Philosophy. Students are not required to have done Legal Theory & Philosophy before taking this course.","Professional and Business Ethics, Regulatory Compliance","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Ethics and social responsibility, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Communities - Cultures of the Modern World, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - General Education - Arts, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - PLE: Distribution and Justice Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR-LAW2612,,,
COR-LAW2640,YPHSL,EU-ASEAN Law and Relations,"This course will explore interdisciplinary issues in EU-ASEAN law and relations. The EU and ASEAN are among the world's most advanced regional structures, representing distinct models of integration. Since the 1980s, the evolution of EU-ASEAN relations has offered valuable insights into the multifaceted concept of interregionalism in international law and relations. ASEAN became a priority in the EU's Asia policy agenda following the Treaty of Lisbon, and the European Commission's 2015 ""Trade for All"" strategy articulated an ASEAN approach based on individual agreements, culminating in a region-to-region framework. The recent conclusion of the EU's trade and investment agreements with Singapore and Vietnam reinforces this incremental approach towards realising the EU-ASEAN free trade agreement.

Amidst China's changing status, the impasse in WTO negotiations, and the COVID-19 pandemic, EU-ASEAN legal frameworks and relations have gained prominence on the global stage. In 2020, the two blocs upgraded their ""Dialogue Partnership"" to a ""Strategic Partnership,"" which aimed at enhancing economic and security cooperation, sustainable connectivity, and development. In 2021, the EU's Indo-Pacific strategy underscored its engagement with the ASEAN-led regional architecture, particularly in light of the economic and political impact of the CPTPP and RCEP.

In this SMU-X course, students will explore EU and ASEAN institutions and examine the EU's new Indo-Pacific strategy from legal and political perspectives. The course will specifically evaluate EU-ASEAN economic agreements and focus on cutting-edge areas such as trade and investment liberalisation, AI and digital trade, and sustainable development. Students will gain practical experience by collaborating with legal and policy experts to tackle real-world challenges.

Please note: This course does not include an overseas trip and does not meet SMU's global exposure requirement.

COR-MGMT2207,LKCSB,Innovations for Asia's Smart Cities,"The world is rapidly urbanizing. More and more cities around the world are becoming increasingly popular as economic powerhouses and magnets for migrants from the countryside, suburban areas and other parts of the world. All big cities in both First and Third World countries as well as emerging markets such as New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Dehli, Jakarta etc. have to cope with high population density and serious challenges such as air pollution or traffic congestion. How do we pack more people into big cities and yet continue to achieve a high quality of life? How do we create and manage 'good cities' which are safe, spacious, green, connected, fair and resilient? How can cities create economic wealth while still fulfilling the CSR responsibilities of sustaining a ""Green Planet""? What are the best practice designs and technical smart city solutions which could be leveraged to tackle these challenges and how can they be successfully commercialised? This course will provide answers to these questions with special emphasis on the managerial and commercial aspects of smart city concepts. 

The key lies in creating and effectively managing innovative and sustainable, smart cities able to leverage on new technologies such as smart grids or sensor networks to create a place where people can live, play and work well. Starting from the stakeholder requirements of citizens and planners of innovative cities, the course will introduce students to urban design concepts as well as commercialization, management challenges and implementation issues of the smart city model. There will also be a focus on how good governance and enabling technologies such as sensor networks can facilitate the creation, management and sustainability of 'good' cities.
 
With the help of case studies and resource persons such as industry leaders, innovative city designers, tech experts and business development experts from local and int. companies such as ST Electronics, JTC, Jurong Consultants, Frost & Sullivan, IDA International, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) etc., students will be familiarized with the opportunities and challenges of the 'smart city business' which represents a key element in the value creation and extraction strategy of the Singapore Government and related businesses.","Benefits Management, Business Acumen, Change Management, Talent Management","Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Ethics and social responsibility, Understanding of Sustainability Issues, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Asia Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Communities - Technology, Science and Society, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - General Educatn (Not Appl for Intake 2015 onwards), AREA - Global Asia Electives, AREA - Globalisation Cluster, AREA - Grad Req - SG & Asia Studies (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Grad Req - Sustainability (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Integrative Studies Core, AREA - Public Pol and Public Mgmt Electives, AREA - Smart-City Management & Tech Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Technology Studies Cluster, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR-MGMT2207,,,
COR-MGMT2211,LKCSB,"Harnessing Robotics, UAVs, and Digital Innovation for Business","This course is a response to the increasing use of robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and digital technologies in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War I when the US army experimented with unmanned aerial torpedos. Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations. Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various functionalities of robotics, UAVs and digital innovations in order to critically assess these technologies and to articulate informed opinions about 'the good', 'the bad', and 'the future' of these novel technological developments. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors plus exposure to tech entrepreneurs and digital (corporate) innovation champions.","Business Acumen, Business Ethics and Values Management","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Ethics and social responsibility",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Core-Biz in Context(Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Communities - Technology, Science and Society, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - General Education, AREA - IS Related Courses, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Technology Studies Cluster, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - IDIS103",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR-MGMT2211,,,IDIS103

As A.I. technology is already surpassing human decision-making in certain instances, there is growing concern about 'uncontrolled A.I.' in business and society, incl. regulatory and ethical-legal challenges. Against this background, this new course aims to equip students with foundational, theoretical and practical knowledge about A.I. driven business applications in selected private and public sector organizations. Besides reconstructing the history of artificial intelligence from the 1960s to the current era (as well as a refresher about the basics of computer science algorithms such as audio and video compression algorithms), we will put emphasis on explaining the A.I. driven business models of several top international and local organizations. In order to appreciate the power of A.I. technology, we will take a closer look 'under the A.I. hood' to understand what makes machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and image analysis tick.

COR-MGMT2239,LKCSB,An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Work and Business Models,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has bloomed this year, entering the lives of many students and the general public's use. Historically, there have been different types of AI, but the type underlying the most popular and current AI – neural networks – has become greatly influential in recent years, and has actually been working in the background of many applications for several years already. This AI technology resembles human thinking at neural levels, but are not clear matches to how humans process knowledge. The are now adapted to process language and images, and underlie the most popular kinds of AI, such as ChatGPT and Midjourney. As such, we will focus on these types of AI.

Studies of AIs' impacts from just a few years ago are already outdated due to the rise of these new AIs. In part, this is because the current AI has shown itself to be capable of many feats. This has led to a surge of funding of AI startups, and the emerging industry could be expected to supercharge some firms, tasks, and types of work. 

In order to understand the implications of this type of AI, we will investigate the differences in types of AI and the current technologies that have so attracted investors, firms, and users alike. We will delve into human intelligence and concepts of how intelligence, understanding and meaning are conceived to exist in humans, and to be created in AI. 

We will focus on two implications of the new types of AI. (These will be grounded in the understandings of human intelligence and AI arrived at in the first part of the course). The first is the implications for how work tasks can change (based partly on your own experiments and introspections), and consequently, on the future of jobs and employment. Much of this will be based on the direct use of ChatGPT to assess its capabilities for various kinds of work.

A second type of implication we will study from this grounded basis is that of how different kinds of AI firms and startups, and uses of AI, are emerging. Since much of the impact will come from the embedding of AI in the broader automation of work systems and firms, the broader context will be kept in mind. A business model approach will be used to study these forms of entrepreneurship and transformation.

The course does not employ mathematics or computational work, but AI applications are used and explored, but generally involves higher levels of reasoning, and multi-disciplinary approaches.","Creative Entrepreneurship, Digital Strategies, Futures Thinking, Integrated Problem-Solving, Values Thinking (Normative)","Critical thinking & problem solving, Disciplinary knowledge, Innovation and enterprising skills, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Core-Biz in Context(Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Communities - Technology, Science and Society, AREA - Digital Business Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - IS Related Courses, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - MGMT.240",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR-MGMT2239,,,COR-MGMT2238

These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore. 

Embedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative solutions to make a positive impact on business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with an external SMU-X partner to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact.

The successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, technology, etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will 'stretch' students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a 'real' difference 'out there' in both the social and business sectors.

In terms of effective leader development, in particular, transformative leadership, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment.

This affects our attention, emotions, cognitions, well-being, functioning, and performance. It challenges our ability to flourish, to both feel well and do well. In this course, we explore the science and practice of mindfulness as a way of flourishing at work and in life. Mindfulness-based practices are rooted in Eastern contemplative traditions but have been adapted to a secular, modern context. A large amount of research has accumulated, showing that such mindfulness-based practices confer numerous benefits both for well-being and functioning, including at the workplace. 

""Mindfulness at work"" has two meanings in this course: First, we will focus on mindfulness in the context of work and organizations. Second, we will incorporate mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditations into the course itself. Thus, in this course, we will examine both the science as well as the practice of mindfulness. For the science aspect, we will read and discuss scientific research studies on mindfulness related to each of the course topics. For the practice aspect, we will engage in mindfulness practices based on established and carefully designed secular mindfulness trainings. The practice aspect is integral to this course and students will be required to commit about 20-45 minutes daily to these practices. Evidence suggests that the practices can help individuals feel and function better and are a good investment of the students' time.","Business Ethics and Values Management, Labour Relations Management, Leadership Development, Management Decision Making, Work-Life Harmony","Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Ethics and social responsibility, Understanding of Sustainability Issues, Self-directed learning, Resilience",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Communities - Technology, Science and Society, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Org Behaviour & HR Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR-OBHR2247,,,

Today's policy problems are described as 'wicked problems' that lack a set of clear definitions, causes and effects, and solutions. The wicked nature of the policy problems requires considering the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and innovative policy solutions. This course explores how governments and their stakeholders have experimented with new ideas, policies, governing processes, institutional arrangements, management tools, and technologies, to create public value and effect positive change. Using cases studies from a variety of policy areas and different countries, the course encourages students to understand the opportunities and challenges of public sector change initiatives including collaborative governance, e-governance, and coproduction.

COR1301,LKCSB,Leadership and Team Building,"The overall objective of this module is to build and develop students' competency in leadership and teamwork skills. The course employs both a theoretical and an experiential learning approach with the aim of fulfilling the objectives as outlined below.

Students will gain knowledge and skills about leadership development and team-building skills based on theories, principles, concepts, application, exercises/class activities, self-assessments/instruments, and experiential learning. 

Central to the course is the action-based and experiential Group Project Assignment that offers an opportunity for students to work in groups to collaborate with a non-profit organization or profit-based organization that upholds community development and/or corporate social responsibility or sustainability initiatives1, that is, they initiate and act as idea champions to contribute to community with a project of their own and approach beneficiaries along the way to amend or improve on their ideas. Students are also free to work with any profit and/or non-profit organization on an existing or new project they may have, provided such opportunities exist and are offered to students.  

As idea champions, students work in groups, to develop/invent a prototype/model or mobile application or put into place a process, program or plan such as a business plan that will value-add and contribute to the needs of the beneficiary or organization of their choice. It is entirely up to the leadership of the organization concerned whether they would consider implementing or not implementing what students have designed. In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.

The outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:
(i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today's leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond. 
(ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders' experiences.
(iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.
(iv) Each student will also reflect on his/her own learning throughout the project from start to end as outlined below (see 'Reflection Essay' for details).

With proper data collection, preparation, analysis and modelling, insights can be achieved leading to better decision making and actions that create positive impact. Data analytics is divided into different levels namely, descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics and automated (or embedded) analytics.

In this course, students will acquire practical skills in modelling and analysis to resolve business problems using software tools including Excel and Tableau. Knowing how to effectively use these tools to build models and analyse data to solve problems will add tremendous value in our students' future professional career. 

This course's primary focus is on using Excel spreadsheet as a platform to build mathematical models from scratch to represent business problems for detailed analysis. The use of such models to drive understanding and consensus towards generating insights and actions enhanced the assurance of execution success. With the data collected, data manipulation and transformation will be needed to prepare the data into useful forms for analysis. In terms of data analytics, this course will cover descriptive analytics, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics, using both Excel and Tableau. In-class exercises would be used to present business problem modeling and analysis. Students would interactively develop the skills and experience to deal with open-ended questions, unclear assumptions and incomplete information.

In addition to the individual assessments (take-home assignments and in-class quizzes), a group project will allow students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired to solve a business problem of their choice end-to-end where they will define the business questions, collect the necessary data, build the models, perform the data analytics, to draw insights and conclusions.","Data Analytics, Business Requirements Mapping, Process Improvement and Optimisation, Business Performance Management","Disciplinary Knowledge, Multidisciplinary Knowledge, Interdisciplinary Knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving",GRD - Graded,"AREA - 2nd Major Only - Information Systems, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Capabilities - Managing, AREA - Data Science and Analytics Electives, AREA - Grad Req - Dig Tech/Data Ana (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Information Systems Core (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Tech for Business Core (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - Technology & Entrepreneurship, AREA - Technology Studies Cluster, RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR1305,,,

COR2220,CIS,Digital Law and Technological Innovations,"This course is dedicated to curious laypersons. In your professional life after graduation, whatever your chosen field, you will face two certainties. First, a professional matter which involves machine learning or the Blockchain. Second, you will work with a lawyer! This course gives you a toolkit, a shorthand for constructive dialogue with a lawyer's concerns, to solve your problems within your domain expertise.
Consider this example: what is your understanding of a ""token""? A banker might think about asset ownership records, and link a ""token"" to ""accounts"". To a programmer, a ""token"" could be a technical standard for a fungible unit of value on the Blockchain. In contrast, a lawyer understands a ""token"" based on legislation or judge-made law. Significantly, lawyers have an exclusive right to advocate for all your professional interests in a court of law.
This course will cover legal reactions to technological innovations in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We will examine case studies in Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain concerning, for instance, autonomous vehicles and smart contracts, which are dumb contracts.
Lawyers are trained to shape these realities with words by manipulating natural language.

COR2226,CIS,"Information Technology Policy, Law and Regulations","New economies have emerged within the last two decades including digital models of transaction and disruptive innovations to major industries. Electronic commerce has become ubiquitous as is digital forms of human interaction and communication. Also, Internet intermediaries have taken on a major role as facilitators of commercial and non-commercial transactions online. These include social networking platforms (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and Twitter), multimedia sharing platforms (e.g. YouTube, Apple Music, Spotify), search engines and news aggregators (e.g. Yahoo and Google), content hosts and storage facilities (e.g. Dropbox) and many others. Law and policy have to be adapted to deal with the roles and functions of such forms of engagement and the parties involved. Regulators in every jurisdiction are faced with the challenge to manage the new economy and players, and to balance the interest of multiple parties, in the context of areas of law including intellectual property, data protection, cloud technology and cyber-security. The social effects of the development and use of Infocomm technology have to be tackled as well, including privacy, harassment, cyberstalking and access to content.

COR2229,CIS,Game Theory for Modern Challenges,"This course uses some of the most pressing global problems to motivate learning of the concepts and methods of game theory. Game theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with strategic interactions: situations where the benefits and costs of each agent or actor depends not just on her actions but also on the actions chosen by other agents. Many problems of global concern, like climate change, the use of artificial intelligence, pandemics, and great power conflicts, are characterized by the tension between self-interest and cooperation, miscommunication, and misalignment of incentives. Game theory is a powerful and incisive tool to analyse these issues because it has been used extensively to address collective-action challenges, which are at the heart of most game-theoretical applications in the social sciences; moreover, solutions to these challenges must account for information manipulation and unintended consequences, which are core game theory concepts.  Collective-action problems are situations where the objectives of the whole society or collective are best served if its members take a particular action or actions; however, as these actions are costly, and one can free-ride on others' actions, individuals are disincentivized from cooperating. To solve these problems, game theory looks at how the strategic interaction among members can be improved to generate cooperation.  This course is designed for non-economics majors who want an accessible but also comprehensive and challenging introduction to the game-theoretic tools and principles essential for understanding the nature and possible solutions to collective-action problems without taking a standard game theory course.

COR2253,CIS,Making Sense of Machines: A History of Technology,"To understand AI, the production of data centers and supercomputers, and the hype around new biotechnologies, one must locate technology beyond its possible uses today and the dependence on abstract ethical principles that flow from such a thin engagement with technology. We must look to history. The consequences of superficial engagements with technology are readily seen in 
the way that META (Facebook), Twitter, and OpenAI have become embroiled in controversies. In short, these technologists have not engaged with the most fundamental question: what is technology? 

The main argument of this course is that a deeper understanding of the nature of technology can only be found through its history. Therefore, this course will explore the history of technology in the Western world in the twentieth century. Moreover, the key framework guiding our historical exploration is that technology and society, or technology and culture, emerged together. 

Following a historical approach to studying the relationship between technology and culture, we will explore technologies as innovations made by scientists and engineers, as well as their unremarkable daily use and tinkering by non-experts and enthusiasts alike. Starting with a brief examination of automata, clocks, and androids, we will look at steam engines, railroads, washing 
machines, phonographs, the Autobahn, atomic bombs, the ""flood of data,"" and computers, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotechnologies. 

We will also investigate the cultural aspects of technology, such as the cyberpunk culture and technological futurisms found in cultural products like the movies Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner. Understanding the context in which the ""open source"" and hacker movement began will further illuminate the complex interplay between technology and culture. And perhaps, more 
relevant to our world today, we can start to really grapple with the idea of a ""machine in the garden"" that was characteristic at the beginning of the 20th century. Doing so will reveal how the drive to create a human-built world accompanied the tensions between paradise and domination, war and peace, and organic and the machine.

Singapore is both a city and a country contained in a small geographical space located in Southeast Asia.  It houses a diverse population in terms of race, language, religion, class and nationality.  It possesses no natural resources, but has a highly educated labour force.  Its economy has experienced significant growth rates, particularly in the late 70s and early 80s, coupled with low unemployment.  

Like most other more developed economies, it now confronts a range of socioeconomic issues (rapidly ageing population, declining fertility rates, widening income inequality, rising costs of living) amidst increasing global competition, technological advancements, and security threats.  At the same time, Singaporeans have become more of a people with a stronger national identity, a greater propensity to participate in the decisions that affect the destiny of the country, and a wider range of views and voices on the future direction of Singapore, the challenges it confronts, and the strategies and means by which to achieve their preferred goal(s) for themselves, their children, and the country.",-,-,PNP - Pass/Fail,"AREA - Communities - Cultures of the Modern World, AREA - General Education - Arts, AREA - Grad Req - SG & Asia Studies (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Singapore Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR2603,,,

COR2619,CIS,Fashioning a Nation,"Nations have long sought to evoke loyalty and personal attachment, while in turn providing those living within it with a collective experience and common destiny. The potent force of the nation as a cognitive idea is at the heart of this course, which conceives of the making of a nation as an ongoing work in progress in which everyone has a stake. The central question that we will investigate concerns the reciprocal influences between the nation, its institutional manifestations and 'the people'. How do 'the people' shape institutions and fashion a nation on a daily basis and vice versa?
To explore these relationships, the course is structured around three themes: prerequisites, process and practice. The first theme provides the general conceptual framework through a series of brief discussions of what a nation is, how it relates to a state and to a 'people'. The second theme is devoted to what is often seen as the quintessential nation-building moment: the formal drafting of a constitution. We will consider the choice of language in that text to harness the people's fidelity to the budding nation as well as the respective roles played by the elites and ordinary citizens during the constitution-process. For the third theme, we will probe the lived reality of how the nation constitutes itself every day through its people, from the elites who claim to speak on behalf of the nation in formal rule-making to the personification of the nation in image, song and icon to the architectural design of state institutions and public spaces and the wearing of folk costumes or traditional outfits that seek to give expression to the identity of the nation.
Our explorations will feature the experiences of a diverse range of nations located within and outside Asia. These will provide the backdrop against which the Singapore story will be considered, thereby allowing students to interrogate the familiar domestic narrative of nation-building from a comparative angle. The approach taken will be practically grounded and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from law, political theory, history, linguistics, architecture and the arts. To do so effectively, the course will be team-taught by two instructors with complementary disciplinary backgrounds.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Communities - Cultures of the Modern World, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Political Science Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR2619,,,

This third age of human existence is characterised by retirement from full-time work and a new way of spending time (Carr & Komp, 2011). Through class discussions and group projects, students will dive deeper into disciplines like gerontology, social sciences (intergenerational; social connectedness), public policy (successful ageing), economics (retirement) and technological developments in the ageing space.

We begin by tracing the formation of 'Orientalist' stereotypes about Asia in World Literature, illuminating the role these texts played in the Western colonial project. Next, we interrogate how Asian nationalists and creative practitioners sought to move beyond these Orientalist tropes by adapting Shakespeare's plays to create bold, new intercultural performances. We then dive into a range of canonical Asian texts and their contemporary adaptations.

COR2623,CIS,Tocqueville's Democracy in America and Beyond,"Hailed as ""the greatest book on democracy ever written,"" Tocqueville's Democracy in America offers a window into much more than the United States visited by Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s. Indeed, Tocqueville believed he ""saw in America"" an image of the future everywhere, for he believed that equality of conditions from which democratic society grew was the world's inevitable future.  Having reached its most developed form in the United States, equality of conditions modified and transformed all aspects of life, from politics to social relations, to personal relations, to intellectual life, to individual character and values. Given this radical transformation of the world, Tocqueville believed that ""A new political science is needed for a world entirely new,"" and Democracy in America articulates this new political science.  Tocqueville's masterpiece, then, looks beyond its US context, for Tocqueville hoped to teach his readers what they could hope and fear from democracy, as well as how democratic society might be ""educated"" to avoid some of the dangers to which it is prone.  

This course takes its inspiration from Tocqueville's ambition, by approaching Democracy in America thematically and using Tocqueville's study as a basis for broader inquiry into features of contemporary democratic society. Each week of the course will focus on a key theme in Democracy in America, and each week will pair that theme with current scholarship applying and extending elements of the Tocquevillian perspective to contemporary contexts.

We interrogate what 'selfhood' means to a range of established and emerging Asian writers, asking how and why they construct gender and ethnic identities in their works, and what insights this provides into the Asian psyche. We begin by interrogating gender in Singapore, asking how dramatists and novelists envision life as a 'woman' or a 'man' here. We then circle outwards across Indonesia, India and Iran, tracing how letters, novels, films and graphic novels have been used to create and challenge gender norms from the colonial 19th century to the postcolonial 21st. Next, we look at ethnicity, debating its relative mutability, and querying the importance of physical markers of 'racial' difference relative to evolving national borders and spiritual and societal practices. We trace how Singaporean and Malaysian writers construct ethnicity in their prose fiction, before considering how authors further afield in East Asia (Japan and China) and West Asia (Turkey and Afghanistan) have re-interpreted communal identities over time. We conclude by considering the future of ethnic and gender identities in Asia. By the end of this literary odyssey, students will have gained a wide-ranging appreciation of how modern Asian writers envision gender and ethnicity, and contemplated the relevance of these fictive visions to their own sense of selfhood as young adults living in Asia.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Asia Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Communities - Cultures of the Modern World, AREA - Global Asia Electives, AREA - Grad Req - SG & Asia Studies (Intake 2024 onwards), ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR2626,,,

COR2631,CIS,Scratches on their Minds: Images of Asia in Hollywood,"Film is one of the most important cultural materials through which we learn about people, places, and ideas past and present. Film mirrors and co-produces our understanding of the world and our place in it. Through film, we encounter societies and cultures beyond our own; and the world sees images of who we are through
filmic representations of ourselves. In this course, we explore the ways in which film has served as a space for the production, contestation, and meditation of representations and images of Asia in the United States through the lens of Hollywood films.
This course is designed to provide an interdisciplinary and visual approach to understanding Asia's representations and images on/in Hollywood films. First, we will briefly explore America's perceptions and ideas about Asia in the late 19th century and discuss various methods of reading films as texts. Second, we will
critically examine what Hollywood films reveal about America's perceptions and ideas about Asia within the context of Asia's entangled history with the United States from the late 19th century to 1990s - from the period of American imperial expansion, America's orientalism, US occupation of Japan, the Cold War, and
America's involvement in Vietnam. Next, we will explore the recent trajectories in Hollywood that shaped/reconfigured Asia's filmic representation - the commodification of Asia in Hollywood, the impact of 9/11 on Hollywood's image of Asia, and the shifting aspects of Asian identities (gender and race) in
contemporary Hollywood films.

COR2645,CIS,Cultural Economics,"This course explores the dynamic intersection of economics, culture, creativity, and innovation using the theories and methods of economics to understand traditional arts (performing arts, visual art, and literature), heritage (museums and other forms of built heritage), and creative industries (music, film, games, broadcasting, and publishing). Students will analyse how cultural goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed, with attention to issues such as the valuation of creativity, intellectual property rights, the impact of digitisation on creative markets, and the links between technology, cultural dynamics, and cultural policy. 
By investigating economic frameworks, cultural policy, and real-world case studies, the course offers a comprehensive view of how the creative industries are not just affected by technology, globalisation, and economic change but also, in turn, bolster the economy and create the cultural capital needed for a society's self-image and quality of life. Aside from business and arts and culture management students, the course is ideal for students from a wide range of disciplines who are curious about the economic dimensions of cultural production and its broader social implications. Whether you aspire to work in the creative industries, engage in policymaking, or simply understand the economic forces shaping cultural trends, this course will provide valuable insights. Prior knowledge of economics is not required, but an interest in cultural phenomena and their market dynamics is encouraged.
As an interdisciplinary offering, cultural economics delves into the interactions between economic forces, cultural dynamics, psychological drivers, and social networks. Creative industries are not just about producing goods or services for profit; they are also about creating new cultural meanings, social connections, and
emotional experiences. This complexity demands an approach that draws relies not just on the economics lens but also draws on insights from various disciplines—arts management, sociology, psychology, cultural policy, and innovation studies—making cultural economics a truly interdisciplinary field.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Communities - Cultures of the Modern World, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - PLE: Distribution and Justice Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR2645,,,

When are they followed and when flouted? How do they change (or, not) over time? While different disciplines have attempted to provide answers to these questions, this course challenges students to integrate these disparate hypotheses, using adisciplinary theoretical frameworks such as Game Theory, Network Theory and Evolutionary Theory, to produce a comprehensive understanding of social norms.

In this course students learn to distinguish between social norms, fads, conventions, moral norms and laws. In addition, the course attunes students to the cultural variation in normative content found across the range of human experience and challenges them to explore the conditions under which, cultural variety develops (or fails to). Finally, the course discusses the plethora of reasons why individuals follow norms and its implication for the stability of social norms.

Taken together, this course enables students to apply a normative perspective towards understanding social phenomena and institutions. More importantly, it equips students with evidence and theory-based capacity to design interventions to implement social change by changing the norms that underpin social behaviour. In a world where polarisation and social friction can be reduced to conflict over what a society's norms should look like, and whose medium to long term future depends on our making sustainable choices, this knowledge is key to building a more tolerant and sustainable future.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Communities - Cultures of the Modern World, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=COR2647,,,

CS425,SCIS,Generative AI for Natural Language Communication,"Natural Language Communication (NLC) is the convergence of a diverse set of human language technologies that enable computer systems to interact reasonably with people in a natural and human-like way. NLC requires considering human language as the central part of communicative channel, where the computer should be able to perform a series of language processing actions:
- It should correctly process our written or spoken utterances as input in order to respond accordingly;
- It should allow technology to understand complex sentences, which may contain multiple pieces of information and many turns of requests;
- It can then react by reasoning and/or interrogating and synthesising various data from third-party systems or external knowledge, and use that information in generating sensible responses.

In this course, we will cover diverse fundamental methods and techniques across the themes of natural language processing, understanding and generation that are indispensable for constructing modern NLC systems. We will be focused on introducing and discussing the underlying computational models, data resources, toolkits, and practising them in developing interactive information seeking, dialogue, and cross-language communication systems.

CS426,SCIS,Agent-based Modeling and Simulation,"In this course, we introduce agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) as an approach for studying complex business and social processes. With examples from domains such as transportation, economics, finance, and urban planning, we show how ABMS can help us better understand complex business and social phenomena. ABMS systems are particularly powerful if we want to describe a system populated by many independent and heterogeneous decision makers (who can be collaborators or competitors). ABMS systems can also be used in performing policy evaluations and generating decision supports, as we can then computationally test how changes in parameters at different levels would affect various performance indicators.

Besides covering theoretic foundations of ABMS, we focus heavily on hands-on learning as well. In particular, we will expose students to NetLogo, an intuitive yet powerful modeling language for building ABMS systems. We will be learning NetLogo by building several classical ABMS examples incrementally in class.

Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:
• Understand what is an ABMS.
• Evaluate the pros and cons of using an ABMS system in describing selected real-world phenomena.
• Utilize ABMS systems in policy/strategy evaluations.
• Appreciate the importance of considering uncertainty and opponent modeling when designing strategic, tactic, and operational policies.
• Complete the full cycle of building an ABMS system using the NetLogo programming language:
  o Design an ABMS system with a proper level of granularity and fidelity (defining agents and means of communications).
  o Validate and calibrate the built ABMS. 
  o Interpret the outcome of the ABMS system.","Data Analytics, Applications Development, Computational Modelling, Data Visualisation, Intelligent Reasoning","Disciplinary Knowledge, Multidisciplinary Knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Advanced Business Technology Major, AREA - Analytics Major, AREA - Business Options, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - IS Depth Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Technology & Entrepreneurship, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 1 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - IS200/ IS111/SMT111/CS201, TRCK - Analytics Major: Advanced Technology Track, TRCK - CS/IS: Artificial Intelligence Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=CS426,,,
CS427,SCIS,AI Safety,"With the advancement of systems like GPT, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are anticipated to significantly impact various aspects of individuals' lives. While these AI techniques have demonstrated remarkable, occasionally superhuman, performance across numerous applications, there is a growing concern regarding their safety and security. It has been shown AI systems are subject to a range of attacks, ranging from adversarial attacks (i.e., perturbing an input slightly causes an AI to make completely wrong predictions), backdoor attacks (i.e., backdoors can be easily embedded in neural networks), and privacy-violating attacks such as membership inference attacks (i.e., an adversary may reliably infer whether a certain sample is used during training or not). In addition, AI systems can inherit or amplify biases present in their training data, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Furthermore, many AI models, including GPT, are complex and not easily interpretable. It makes understanding how these models make decisions highly nontrivial, even though it is crucial for trust and accountability. 


This course aims to present a systematic view on the range of AI safety problems that have been identified, analyse their root causes, and study potential approaches to mitigate the safety and security risks.

This first part of the sequence first covers the topic of measurement of macro-economic variables, before easing students into micro-founded macroeconomics by developing a static general equilibrium model with production and using it to analyze a number of fiscal policy issues. The course then moves on to a dynamic
framework and covers the mechanics of long-term economic growth and the role of policy in economic development. Students are then introduced to dynamic decision problems when considering consumption and savings decisions of households and investment decisions of firms, and these building blocks are combined with a Walrasian approach to the labor market to complete the development of a dynamic macroeconomic model, which is then used to consider fiscal policy questions like the role of the timing in taxes and government expenditures.","Macroeconomic Analysis, Critical Thinking, Conceptual Thinking","Disciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Actuarial Science Core, AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Economics Core (Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - PLE Core (Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - ECON111, RQCP - ECON205/104, RQCX - ECON102",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=ECON112,ECON203|ECON210|ECON217|ECON220|ECON235|ECON240|ECON248|ECON252|ECON302|ECON350|PLE401,,ECON102

ECON125,SOE,Economics of the Financial System,"In the financial system funds flow from those who have surplus funds to those who have a shortage of funds, either by direct, market-based financing or by indirect, bank-based finance. A well-developed financial system (comprising money, financial instruments, financial markets, financial institutions, government regulatory agencies and central banks) improves the efficiency of financing decisions, favouring a better allocation of resources and thereby economic growth. What is the underlying mechanism that explains the positive relationship between the degree of development of the financial system and economic development? How should elements of both direct, market-based and indirect, bank-based finance be incorporated? What are the comparative advantages of market vs bank-based finance? In cases where the industry faces strong information asymmetries, is bank-based financing an effective solution to adverse selection and moral hazard problems that exist between good and bad borrowers? What are alternative modes of financing, especially for small medium sized enterprises? What role does fintech play in enabling dynamic and inclusive growth? These are some of the questions we will answer in this course.","Macroeconomic Analysis, Critical Thinking, Conceptual Thinking","Disciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Economics Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - PLE: Public Policy and Governance Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=ECON125,,,

ECON220,SOE,Economic Growth,"The income per capita in the United States and Western Europe is around fifty times greater than in much of sub-Saharan Africa. This prompts the question: Why are some countries rich and others poor? From around 1870 until the Second World War, Japan's income per capita remained around 25 percent of U.S. income per capita. After the substantial reforms put in place at the end of the war, Japanese relative income rose sharply so that today Japanese standard of living is roughly two-thirds that of the U.S. level. The rapid catch-up was also achieved in the post-war period by several other Asian economies including Singapore. What is it that makes it possible for countries to produce growth miracles? For much of world history, people lived at subsistence levels well described by Thomas Malthus. Around the nineteenth century, however, there was an escape from Malthusian stagnation beginning in Europe. What is the engine of economic growth?

ECON222,SOE,"Economics of Privatisation, Regulation and Competition Policy","Since the 1980s, many countries have turned to the private sector to provide services formerly offered by the state.  With freer markets, an adjacent development has been the introduction of elaborate systems of regulation as well as the enactment of competition law regimes.  This course provides an overview of the economic theory relevant to privatization, regulation and competition policy.  The first half of the course will examine the following issues: the rationale for privatization and regulation; strategies for privatization and options for public regulation; evaluation of effects of privatization and regulation; creation of competition and policies toward anti-competitive behavior.  Particular attention will be paid to the electric power, telecommunications and transport sectors.  Relevant cases from different countries will be used to highlight issues and provide a more complete understanding of the options and problems involved.

ECON226,SOE,Urban Economics and Policy,"This course is designed as an introductory course of urban economics. It covers fundamental principles developed in economics to understand the functioning/workings of an urban economy and the various aspects of urban life. Firstly, the course begins with the definition of a city, and why cities form by introducing the economics of agglomeration, and how cities interact to form the urban system of the entire economy. These factors affect all urban phenomena. Secondly, the course analyzes the internal spatial structure of a city by developing a theory of commuting, housing demand and housing production. It then analyzes transportation and land/housing issues in more detail. On transportation, we focus on the economics of traffic congestions, the rationale for congestion pricing (ERP), and the so-called fundamental law of highway congestion. The discussion on land and housing, will address various housing phenomena such as tenure choice and location. The courses will discuss the optimality of local public good provision, and connect local public finance and housing markets with land taxation. Finally, the course addresses the economics of urban planning to comprehend various urban forms that are found in different cities in the world. It will highlight key aspects of Singapore's urban policies, such as the ERP and the Land Acquisition Act 1973. The topics for group projects cover many other urban policies in Singapore and its comparison with other countries, including but not limited to Singapore's master plans.","Microeconomic Analysis, Critical Thinking, Conceptual Thinking, Analysis of Research Data, Data and Statistical Analysis","Disciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Communication, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Understanding of sustainability issues, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Economics Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Public Pol and Public Mgmt Electives, AREA - Smart-City Management & Tech Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - ECON230, RQSR - ECON101 or (ECON111 and ECON 251), TRCK - Economics Major: Real Estate Track, TRCK - Finance Major: Real Estate Track, TRCK - PLE: Public Policy and Governance Track, TRCK - Public Policy, Devt, & Mgt Track (Economics)",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=ECON226,,,ECON230

ECON244,SOE,Behavioural Economics,"This course is a primer on behavioural economics, which examines how psychological, social, and cognitive factors influence economic decision-making. Behavioural economics challenge and enrich the rational-choice framework that permeates neoclassical economics by emphasizing that economic choices are also conditioned by social and cultural forces.

In behavioural economics, psychological insights intersect with economic theory to demonstrate how individuals, groups, and organizations make decisions that depart from the predictions of traditional economic models. Students will gain a deep understanding of prospect theory, cognitive biases, and heuristics—the building blocks of behavioural theory. At the same time, students will also explore how social preferences, shared values, beliefs, norms, customs and institutions influence economic choices. Understanding the interplay between these aspects of culture and behavioural economics is crucial for creating policies, interventions, and business strategies that are both effective and culturally sensitive.

This course is ideal for students in economics, business, psychology, social sciences and related fields who are interested in understanding the behavioural and social aspects of decision-making. The course will help equip students with the knowledge and skills to analyse, explain, and predict real-world behaviour especially in contexts characterised by risk and uncertainty, including consumer choices, marketing, financial decision-making, public policy, political outcomes, and organizational strategy, and to learn how to evaluate and design interventions and strategies to influence decisions and improve outcomes in these settings. Students will enhance their critical and interdisciplinary thinking, analytical skills, and creativity by integrating behavioural concepts with traditional economic frameworks, preparing them to address complex challenges in academia, industry, or government roles.","Microeconomic Analysis, Critical Thinking, Conceptual Thinking, People Management","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Ethics and social responsibility, Understanding of sustainability issues, Self-directed learning, Resilience",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Economics Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Public Pol and Public Mgmt Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - ECON101/111, TRCK - PLE: Choice and Behaviour Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=ECON244,,,

Second, it is to develop a deep understanding of macroeconomic phenomena such as business cycles, long-term economic growth, and the process of economic development, as well as macroeconomic policy issues, such as the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on the economy and the design of a social security system or an unemployment insurance scheme.
This second part of the sequence first reviews the topics of consumption and savings, investment, and the labor market covered in ECON 112 (Macroeconomics 1) and enriches the analysis by considering the impact on consumption and investment decisions of (a) imperfections of the financial sector, for instance leading to the existence of credit constraints, (b) uncertainty, and (c) adjustment costs, as well as by introducing the flow approach to the labor market and using the search and matching framework to understand labor market data and policies. The course then introduces the notion of money and considers the role of financial intermediaries, which are then used to study the long-term impact of monetary policy as well as the role of banking supervision and macro-prudential regulation. The course finally studies business cycles and covers the measurement of cycles, reviews the main existing theories and their policy prescriptions, with a particular emphasis being put on severe recessions or depressions.","Macroeconomic Analysis, Critical Thinking, Conceptual Thinking","Disciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Economics Core (Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - ECON111, RQCP - ECON112, RQCP - ECON205/104, RQCX - ECON102, TRCK - PLE: Public Policy and Governance Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=ECON252,ECON302,,ECON102

FNCE217,LKCSB,Wealth Management and Advisory,"The objective of this course is to introduce wealth management and advisory needs/focuses across client segments spanning from the mass-affluent space to the private high net-worth individual (HNWI) space. Wealth management is to grow, preserve, and transfer wealth to future generations. The traditional focus in investment management has primarily been on institutions. However, with the large growth in private wealth globally and particularly in Asia, wealth management for HNWIs is fast emerging. The course begins with a macro view on the wealth management landscape before advancing to understand the similarities and differences between managing wealth for institutions versus for individuals. With individuals, we will appreciate the need for different investment products and wealth solutions across client segments based on needs and suitability. Students will learn how to risk profile a client using behavioural finance knowledge and models, prepare an investment policy statement (IPS) for a particular client's profile and be able to suggest an asset allocation based on the IPS. As the life cycle stages of a client progresses, the wealth advisory approach must incorporate retirement planning. Students will learn the iterative wealth management and advisory process where client profiling, monitoring and review of investment portfolios, implementation and executions of the investment plans are conducted regularly and dynamically across the life cycle stages of a client.

Ethical behaviour builds trust. We will examine ethical conduct in the investment advisory process and the corporate governance process of banks to encourage ethical behaviour of client advisors. Last but not least, we will introduce sustainability investing as a preference in client's IPS and how to approach ESG requirements of the client.","Behavioural Finance, Personal Financial and Wealth Management","Critical thinking & problem solving, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Finance Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - FNCE101/FNCE103, TRCK - Finance Major: Investment Banking/Banking Track, TRCK - Finance Major: Wealth Management Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=FNCE217,,,

FNCE316,LKCSB,"Financial Literacy, Inclusion, and Technology","Financial literacy is a critical aspect of building financial resilience across the life cycle, requiring both an understanding of fundamental concepts as well as highly context-specific tools and environments. In Singapore, where many key financial decisions are supported by government programmes, the ability to navigate complex systems has always been key. For example, investing and retirement planning involve a grasp of the country's personal income tax system and the CPF system, while homebuying requires understanding the HDB system and mortgage borrowing. Health insurance choices are centered around the basic provisions of Medishield in combination with a range of options around private providers. 
 
The scope of financial literacy is being redefined, both in Singapore and elsewhere, especially as societies begin to recognize the need for finance to be more inclusive and sustainable. The introduction of new enablers also introduces new risks, particularly in the instance of financial technology (fintech). For instance, as fintech unlocks unprecedented access to new services (such as robo advisors, buy-now-pay-later) and products (such as sustainable or ""green"" investment funds), it becomes increasingly important to ensure that consumers are sufficiently well-informed or otherwise protected. 
 
This SMU-X course offers an experiential learning opportunity that allows students to translate classroom knowledge about financial literacy into practical solutions for real organizations that represent the forefront of financial innovation.  The course will focus on initiatives related to building individual financial literacy with respect to new goals and financial services in the context of each organization's current or future business model.

FNCE319,LKCSB,Sustainability Risk Management,"Today's businesses and investors are increasingly dealing with the risks and opportunities of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, due to the scarcity of resources, conflicts in community and labor relations, and climate change. ESG risk management is increasingly vital for companies due to several compelling reasons:

1. Reputation and Brand Value: Companies with strong ESG practices are perceived more positively by consumers, investors, and other stakeholders. Managing ESG risks helps protect and enhance a company's reputation and brand value, reducing the risk of negative publicity and boycotts.

2. Regulatory Compliance: Governments and regulatory bodies are imposing stricter ESG-related regulations. Effective ESG risk management ensures compliance with these regulations, avoiding fines, legal action, and operational disruptions.

3. Investor Demand: Investors are increasingly considering ESG factors in their investment decisions. Companies that manage ESG risks well attract more investment and often benefit from lower capital costs. ESG performance is now a key metric for many institutional investors and funds.

4. Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings: Managing environmental risks can lead to more efficient resource use, waste reduction, and energy savings. Social and governance improvements can enhance employee satisfaction and productivity, reducing turnover and associated costs.

5. Risk Mitigation: ESG risks, such as climate change impacts, social unrest, and governance failures, can have significant financial and operational impacts. Proactively managing these risks helps companies avoid or mitigate potential losses and disruptions.

6. Competitive Advantage: Companies that excel in ESG risk management often have a competitive edge. They are better positioned to anticipate and adapt to market changes, meet stakeholder expectations, and capitalize on new business opportunities related to sustainability and ethical practices.

7. Long-Term Sustainability: ESG risk management supports the long-term sustainability of a company by addressing the broader impacts of its operations on the environment, society, and its governance structure. This holistic approach ensures the company can thrive in the future while contributing positively to the world.

This course will investigate how ESG risk considerations can be integrated into a company's wider Enterprise Risk Management Frameworks.  Focus here will be on Environmental Risk considerations (Climate Change and Nature/Biodiversity), given the importance and regulatory focus that these attract.","Environment and Social Governance, Financial Risk Management, Regulatory Compliance, Risk and Return Analysis and Modelling, Roles and Mechanisms of Financial Markets","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Ethics and social responsibility, Understanding of Sustainability Issues, Resilience",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Finance Electives, AREA - Sustainability Management Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - FNCE101/FNCE103, TRCK - Finance Major: Sustainable Finance Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=FNCE319,,,
FNCE320,LKCSB,Sectoral Decarbonisation Knowledge,"Climate science indicates that to keep global warming within the 1.5°C threshold above preindustrial levels, we must reduce global emissions to reach net zero by 2050. Despite growing recognition of this imperative and increasing corporate commitments to decarbonisation, most of these commitments lack detailed and credible plans. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require a fundamental transformation of the global economy, particularly in the energy and hard-to-abate sectors that contribute the most to global emissions. This transition demands significant investment, estimated at US$3-4 trillion per year, necessitating substantial scaling and deployment of both private and public sector capital.

This course delves into decarbonisation pathways and key climate transition strategies within the energy and hard-to-abate sectors, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to assess credible transition planning and articulate key decarbonisation challenges and growth opportunities in the emergence of new clean technologies. The course also highlights the wider policy landscape and how significant government policies can influence the development of low-carbon products and their supply chains. Additionally, it explores various funding structures to finance companies' decarbonisation strategies, the meaning of sustainable business, and the need for companies to transition in a financially sustainable manner.

By the end of this course, students will understand the challenges and opportunities associated with reducing carbon emissions in traditionally difficult-to-decarbonise sectors such as cement, steel, fossil fuel energy, and transport. They will gain foundational knowledge necessary for finance professionals to assess the viability and impact of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. Students will learn about the technical processes and commercial viability of decarbonisation technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels like hydrogen, as well as geographical considerations, national circumstances, and geopolitical factors. The course will also cover the role of international cooperation, government policies, and private sector initiatives in driving decarbonisation. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to contribute to the development and implementation of effective decarbonisation strategies, fostering a low-carbon future for Asia's most challenging sectors.

The course is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. This includes analysis of viable pathways to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, focusing on the energy and hard-to-abate sectors; exploration of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels; examination of significant government policies and their impact on the development of low-carbon products and supply chains; an overview of different funding mechanisms to support decarbonisation efforts; discussion on the importance of financially sustainable transitions for businesses; and practical examples and case studies to illustrate successful decarbonisation strategies and initiatives. This course is designed to provide students with a well-rounded understanding of the critical issues and innovative solutions in the quest to reduce carbon emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.","Environment and Social Governance, Financial Risk Management, Firm Fundamental Analysis, Regulatory Compliance, Roles and Mechanisms of Financial Markets","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Ethics and social responsibility, Understanding of Sustainability Issues, Resilience",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Finance Electives, AREA - Grad Req - Sustainability (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Law Related Electives, AREA - Sustainability Management Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - FNCE101/FNCE103, TRCK - Accounting Major: Sustainability Accounting Track, TRCK - Finance Major: Sustainable Finance Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=FNCE320,,,

By recognizing the importance of carbon markets, businesses can work to harness their potential to address climate change, promote sustainable development, and support a low-carbon future.

This course will cover established and emerging theories on how companies and individuals can use carbon markets to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will share insights on the global regulations and various aspects with the backdrop of ESG, impact investing, social responsibility, human rights and fintech.

The course will explore the meaning of sustainable carbon markets and how carbon projects respect and protect local communities' rights and interests through several case studies and simple econometric analyses.

What some do as work (in exchange for money), others would gladly do for free. Work is something that most people engage in for economic gain, but the social, psychological, and even political impact is less often examined. Conversely, leisure is often seen as the opposite of work. But some studies indicate that people might actually feel more engaged with work than leisure activities (Csikszentmihalyi, 2008). In this course we explore what work means to people, what leisure provides that work does not, and how individuals go about finding a balance between work and non-work in their lives.

Broadly, the objective of this course is to provide students an opportunity to examine and reflect on different perspectives of work and non-work, and to start them on a journey to determine for themselves what work and non-work could be like in their own lives. Specifically, through class discussions and project work, I hope to be able to provide students a broad perspective on what constitutes work and non-work.

Indeed, a very deliberate and conscious effort, requiring a mixture of laws, institutions, mechanisms and political leadership and will, is needed to maintain ethnic relations in Singapore.

This course seeks to understand and to critically examine the legal framework and policies for the management of ethnic relations in Singapore. Laws alone are manifestly inadequate in maintaining peace on hot-button issues of race, language, and religion.

HUMN019,SOSS,Asian Organised Crime: A Multidisciplinary Perspective,"Organised crime is a multi-factorial social problem. The study of organised crime in Asia has stimulated empirical investigations into a diversity of phenomena including the racialisation of criminals, supply chain organisation of illegal goods and services, corruption of legitimate actors and institutions, white collar criminality, and issues related to legislative frameworks and law enforcment efforts. Although the core subject is crime, efforts to understand, control, and eradicate organised crime in Asia has never been a uniquely criminological or even uniquely sociological endeavor. Instead of a monopoly by any single discipline, research into the field of organised crime in Asia has attracted scholars with diverse academic backgrounds including, psychology, economics, history, law and political science.

This course systematically charts and analyses the multidisciplinary dimensions of the study of organised crime in Asia, by drawing on scientific research done in the field of psychology, sociology, economics, political science, criminology, and cultural studies. Drawing on case study analysis of organised crime in Asia, metaphorical and substantive references to its interdisciplinary dimension will be highlighted on five levels of observation: the individual ""organised criminal"", the activities these individuals are involved in, the associational patterns through which they are connected, the power structures that subordinate these individuals and collectives to common or particular interests, and the relations between these individuals, structures and activities on the one hand, and the legal spheres of society on the other. Subsequently, the course will highlight the advantages and critique the limitations of a multidisciplinary analysis of organised crime in Asia. In general, the study of organised crime has profited from an multidisciplinary approach. In these cases, concepts and theories have been adopted either on the assumption that organised crime is a facet of a larger phenomenon under investigation in other disciplines, or on the assumption that sufficient similarities exist between organised crime and the objects of study of other disciplines in order to permit the drawing of analogies. However, it is equally important to address the caveat that unless the borrowing of eclectic oncepts and theories from a variety of academic disciplines is strategically done to build up a cumulative body of knowledge, efforts to conceptualise, theorise, and police the complex phenomenon of organised crime in Asia will be compromised rather than facilitated.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - General Education - Arts, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=HUMN019,,,

Many populations and governments feel they are unable to cope with the size of this playing field. People feel insecure and governments respond with populist inward-looking nationalism. However, we are individuals in societies. We cannot get away from living with people whose cultures and values we do not understand. Even if we bury our heads in the sand, the globalized world will not go away, for it is a fact of modern times. All of us will have to deal with people from diverse cultures in order to work and live successfully today.

This course gives insight into the thinking of communities other than our own. Religion is a primal response of man. Religion moves people beyond the rational to the transcendental and engenders such strong feelings people will go to war, and are willing to die for their faiths.

IDIS103,SOSS,"Understanding Drone & Robotic Technology - History, Usage, Ethics & Legal Issues","This new course is a response to the increasing use of drone technology and 3D robotics in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about 'the good', 'the bad', and 'the future' of unmanned aerial vehicles.

Students will receive mentorship from both faculty and practitioners of these partner organizations, guiding them to develop practical and implementable solutions. Although the course demands significant effort and time from students, its journey and outcomes can be highly rewarding. All SMU-XO courses meet the Global Exposure requirement.

With a focus on project-based experiential learning and cross-cultural understanding, SMU-XO courses aim to:
•	Enhance awareness of interdisciplinary connections and differences, encouraging knowledge integration to address issues or challenges.
•	Foster a deeper understanding of business opportunities and challenges in various global markets and economies relevant to students' interests.
•	Familiarize students with informal networks and emphasize leveraging SMU-related networks in a global context.
•	Provide global exposure to cultivate culturally sensitive global citizens.
•	Encourage adaptation to new environments and leadership development.
•	Promote creative and critical problem-solving skills.
•	Support sound decision-making in complex situations.
•	Enhance collaborative and productive teamwork.

This course focuses on Southeast Asia, but may include South Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. The partner organization will have a need for strategic planning and communication, whether they have never conducted such planning or need to update an existing plan. In addressing that need, students will develop a communication strategy within the social marketing and strategic communication frameworks based on fieldwork in the host community.

The first half of the semester involves lectures about key issues in sustainable development, social marketing, and strategic communication. It also involves discussions with representatives from the partner organization, partner organisations, and communication practitioners who can guide preparation for the fieldwork.

During recess week, and with the support of the partner organisation, students will interview, document, and observe members of the host community as part of formative research in formulating a communication strategy. This immersive experience will provide students with new perspectives on some of the challenges facing people and the planet. It will be an opportunity to put theory into practice and, hopefully, have a positive impact in the world.

In the second half of the semester, students will refine their communication strategies and develop communication collaterals. They will also reflect on the long-term sustainability of the strategy and how to evaluate its effectiveness. The semester ends with the presentation of the communication strategy before a panel composed of the course instructor and representatives from the partner organisation and other interested individuals.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Global Asia Electives, AREA - Sustainability Management Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=IDIS201,,,

INTS304,CIS,The Human Condition: Who are we? What are we?,"This course is a meditation on ourselves; it attempts to answer the fundamental question of what it means to be human by integrating insights from psychology, sociology, anthropology, behavioural science, evolutionary psychology, cultural evolution, and philosophy. By surveying the cultural variation – across space and time – in the ways human beings have lived their lives, we identify the ways in which the human experience of the world is, at the same time, both universal and culturally contingent. We also consider how the human experience of the world compares with the corresponding experience of non-human animals. Where possible, we situate the discussion within the conceptual framework of Niko Tinbergen's four foundational questions about mechanism, ontogeny, function, and phylogeny.

This course is divided into two sections: the first looks at the nuts and bolts that make human experience possible – culture, sociality, cognition and behaviour – and ends with a synthetic account of human identity. The second half of the course focusses on domains of experience that are, to a large degree, distinct to humans, and are universal to the human repertoire across cultural contexts. Here we ask, what makes it possible for us to love, to worship, to be kind, to be moral and to be cruelly violent. 

Understanding the human condition is crucial for not only making meaning of our individually finite but collectively extensive lives, but also for fostering empathy across cultural and biological boundaries for other humans – past, current and future – and non human animals. This empathy might be the key to sustainable inter-human and human-planet relations.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Integrative Studies Core, RQPR - Applicable for BIS, D3 and ISM only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=INTS304,,,

Which is the company's market share in different geographical areas?  Where are the customers located?  What are the characteristics of customers in different geographical locations?  Are there potential customers and where do they live?  
• Site Selection
Where are the shops or branches of the company located today?  Where are the competitors located?  What would be the surrounding market area for a new location?  What are the socio-economic characteristics of the people living in this market area?  Will the establishment of a new shop interfere with the existing shop owned by the company?  Are the land prices in different areas suitable for building a new shop?
• Sales territories
Which the company's present division into sales territories?  What kind of customers live in these districts and how much is sold?  Is there a need for more salesmen in any district?  Could redistricting lead to more efficient sales organisation and less travelling time for the salesmen?
• Distribution and travel costs
How can the distribution system be made more efficient?  In what way does the transport system influence the distribution and how does it restrict or facilitate expansion in the region?  Can the number of journeys made by company staff be reduced by applying route planning software?  Are there any alternatives to our present distribution system?
 • Analysis of the global environment and new export markets
What is the general economic and spatial pattern in the region?  How good is the infrastructure?  How is the population distributed geographically?  Which other companies are present in the region and where are they located?  Is this region a potential export market for the company's products?

IS457,SCIS,Fairness in Socio-technical Systems,"We interact with a variety of services and systems in our daily lives. While manual labors still take some part in those systems, some other parts become more and more automated by artificial intelligence (AI). In general, we might expect that those systems treat users fairly. If the system uses AI that is built on big data and complex algorithms, such expectation would be strengthened. Compared to human labor that might involve subjective decision-making, algorithmic systems are expected to objectively work and treat users fairly. However, in recent years, there are raising concerns about the potential harms of those systems, which are rooted in biases embedded in socio-technical systems. The inherent opaque nature of AI systems makes the problem worse.
For example, YouTube recommends next videos when a video is finished playing. Those recommendations, on the one hand, are helpful to find interesting videos from a tremendous number of YouTube videos, but on the other hand, it is often unclear how or why the video is recommended. What happens if some biases exist in the recommendation algorithm, such as favoring videos with a specific (political) view? No matter whether those biases are intentional or unintentional, users would be exposed to a certain set of videos and are likely to be influenced by them.  
YouTube is only one out of many examples because AI systems are becoming pervasive these days. In various areas, including healthcare, hiring, financial service, ads, policymaking, and internet services, AI systems are actively used. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that those systems are working fairly without any potential biases. It might be overlooked that the biases are embedded not only in the AI systems but also in established processes or human operators within the systems.
The goal of this course is to provide students with an extensive understanding of diverse concepts of fairness and bias in socio-technical systems through examples across diverse domains, from healthcare to internet search. Then, students will learn how to audit practical systems in terms of fairness and bias through recent case studies.

Project selections do not need to be unique, meaning multiple teams can select the same project idea. 
 
Each student project team will be assigned to a sponsor and an SMU faculty supervisor.  Sponsors will provide project scope and management for student teams to have practical industry learning experiences.  Student teams will have weekly check in meetings, either virtually or physically, with their sponsor.  
 
Student project teams will be expected to develop a working software application prototype, to be delivered to the sponsor at the end of the course.  Sponsors will specify the technologies to be used, including; development tools/languages, OS, database, 3rd party libraries, target deployment environment e.g. cloud environment.","Business Requirements Mapping, Change Management, Project Management, Agile Software Development, Applications Development","Disciplinary Knowledge, Multidisciplinary Knowledge, Interdisciplinary Knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Self-directed learning, Resilience",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Computing & Law Core (Intake 2020 to 2023), AREA - Grad Req - Dig Tech/Data Ana (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - IS Project and Depth Electives, AREA - Information Systems Core (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Smart-City Mgmt & Tech Core (Intake 2019 to 2021), AREA - Smart-City Mgmt & Tech Core (Intake 2022 onwards), RQPR - Applicable for BSc (IS) and BSc (C&L) only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=IS484,,,

This course will first equip students with skills to identify rules of international law through discussions about sources of international law, and the tools to interpret such norms. Importantly, given the nebulous nature of certain areas of international law, students will learn to craft arguments advocating for or against the existence of certain international rules. This course will also cover certain foundational areas of international law, such as that of jurisdiction (when a court/tribunal can hear a dispute) and state responsibility (when a state is responsible for an act or omission). Following which, this course will narrow in on specific substantive areas of international law, where students will be exposed to the rules and unique challenges in these fields.

LAW.410,YPHSL,World Trade Organization: Law and Policy,"While rather young compared to other international organizations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has quickly become the most important international organization for business firms across the globe. Its ever expansive rules now cover issues including trade in both industrial and agricultural products, trade in services, labor mobility, investment, free trade agreements, health and food safety, and a wide variety of domestic regulatory regimes. Thus, it is important that lawyers advising business firms understand these rules so they may help the clients to structure their transactions to maximize their benefits and minimize the costs. 

This course will help the students to study the legal rules of the WTO, which cover tariff measures, antidumping and safeguard measures, food safety regulations, as well as domestic regulatory requirements. Using real WTO cases decided by the WTO tribunals as examples, the students will be able to critically examine how these rules are made, what are the impacts on business firms, how to argue the best case for their clients, and how these rules could be improved in the future. Taught by a former WTO staff member who is among a handful of people in the world who has worked on WTO cases at both Panel and Appellate Body levels as an insider, the students will also gain valuable insight into the WTO dispute settlement process, which arguably is the most important international tribunal in the world today. 

The knowledge and skills learnt in this course will be helpful for students to explore a wide range of career options, including private law firms, government agencies (MFA, MTI), multinational companies, and international organizations (WTO, World Bank).","International Trade Legislation Compliance, Corporate and Business Law, Regulatory Compliance, Regulatory Risk Assessment, Regulatory Risk Assessment","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Global & Regional Studies, AREA - Globalisation Cluster, AREA - Intl & Asian Studies Major, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Public Pol and Public Mgmt Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - LAW422, RQCX - LGST227, TRCK - PLE: Global Studies Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW.410,,,LAW422

It will examine the various institutional and process responses to international crimes and their relation to international human rights and access to justice. It will consider the different paradigms of justice that inform diverse international developments, notably contrasts between retributive and restorative justice. The course will investigate tensions and conflicts between nation-state based criminal justice and international norms, processes and procedures for regulating crime. It will assess the extent to which a distinct international criminal justice order is being established, the nature of its jurisprudence and values and its implications.

Further, it will offer students an understanding of criminal justice that is sensitive to debates about globalisation, policy transfer in comparative as well as international contexts. It will explore the nature of trans-national crimes and responses that seek the governance of global risk/security priorities, including financial crime and international terrorism. The course will analyse the role of the international criminal courts (and tribunals) and the different models of justice implied in competing international justice developments. In particular it will focus on debates between punitive and restorative justice principles from the perspective of legitimate victim interests.

The technological developments from Web 1.0 to 2.0 and the future of Web 3.0 with its impact on human interaction and B2B/B2C commerce as well as e-governance will be examined in the context of civil and criminal law, both in the relevance of old laws and the enactment of new ones. In particular, this course examines the laws specifically arising from and relating to electronic transactions and interaction and their objectives and impact on the individual vis-à-vis other parties.

Students will be taken through the policy considerations and general Singapore legislations and judicial decisions on the subject with comparisons and reference to foreign legislation where relevant. In particular, electronic commerce and other forms of transactions will be studied with reference to the Electronic Transactions Act (2010); personal data privacy and protection will be studied with reference to the Personal Data Protection Act of 2012 and the Spam Control Act; the challenges and changes to tort law to deal with online tortious conduct will be analysed (e.g. cyber-harassment and online defamation), and the rights and liabilities relating to personal uses of Internet content and user-generated content will also be considered.

LAW.473,YPHSL,Information & Communication Technology and Law: Intermediaries,"Students taking this course will examine the legal issues and solutions arising from transactions through the use of digital information, goods and services as well as via non-physical - analog and digital - channels of communication and delivery. The technological developments from Web 1.0 to 2.0 and the future of Web 3.0 have led to new economies and economic models of transaction and governance. B2B/B2C commerce and e-governance have emerged with new players, in the form of Internet intermediaries, taking on a major role as facilitators of commercial and non-commercial transactions online. These include social networking platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), multimedia sharing platforms (e.g. YouTube, Apple Music, Spotify), search engines and news aggregators (e.g. Yahoo and Google), content hosts and storage facilities (e.g. Dropbox and Bittorrent) and many others. 

Laws have been adapted to deal with the roles and functions of such intermediaries and in particular, different jurisdictions are faced with the challenge to manage the new economy and players, and to balance the interest of multiple parties, in the context of areas of law including intellectual property, data protection, privacy and cyber-security. Different types of safe harbor laws and exceptions have emerged to protect these intermediaries, while some forms of protections have been augmented to protect the interests of other parties including content providers and creators as well as society at large. 

Students will be taken through the policy considerations and general Singapore legislations and judicial decisions on the subject with comparisons and reference to foreign legislation where relevant, especially where comparative analysis is important to the understanding of the global regime and trends, and to the interpretation of the local provisions that have an impact on intermediaries.

The plaintiff is based in Indonesia, the defendant accounting firm is in the Netherlands, and the defendant's insurer has its headquarters in the United States.  All agree to attend mediation in Singapore. The preliminary discussions and meetings, however, take place via email and video-conference with all parties in their home countries.  The mediation occurs and the parties reach a settlement, which the parties' legal representatives draft into contractual form.

Such cross-border mediations involve:
•	international and intercultural competencies;
•	online and face-to-face mediation protocols; and
•	knowledge of private international law in relation to the substantive and procedural aspects of mediation.

LAW.486,YPHSL,Privacy and Data Protection Law,"In the information age, the production and management of data will define the future of governance and businesses. The 'data economy' renders digitized information - promulgating at ever increasing speed – a valuable asset through the use of data analytics. It has also led to a fundamental shift in power and markets. The emergence of disruptive technological and business innovations is one prominent example of such a change. New economies are formed, such as from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the development of 'cognitive services', the digitization of goods and the provision of storage/sharing and management services. Governments, including the Singapore public sector, are also aware of the importance of data to governance and to the future of the economy and are driving innovations and technology usage within that sector as well as in society generally through the Smart Nation initiative and Digital Economy drive. Substantial research and development are also encouraged in this field.

These fundamental shifts also lead to many problems and challenges related to different types of data and data sets. For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and the data economy generally, cybersecurity is a major concern. In relation to personal data and digital communications, there are various threats to different forms of privacy. Other current issues surrounding data are the 'fake news' phenomenon and the persistent threats to intellectual property. On the flipside, these developments have also led to new industries (and careers) such as in the areas of cybersecurity and data protection.

The objective of this course is to prepare students who are interested in data protection law and may have an interest in making a career in this nascent industry that is set to grow. Students will first be introduced to the data economy as a concept and to the real changes to the market and to society as well as the various forms and categorisations of data and the legal aspects to these data sets. The second part of the course will then focus on privacy law and its relationship with data protection (DP) law. In this context, comparative study will be made of privacy and DP regimes of significance (e.g. OECD, EU, APEC, etc.). Third, students will then focus their study on the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (and other relevant laws) – in particular, the data protection and do not call provisions - by looking at its history, objective, scope/application and possible future developments e.g. Data Protection Ecosystem and PDPA Act Review. Comparative study of similar concepts and processes in other jurisdictions will also be assessed in the course of the study of the Singapore PDPA. The fundamental concepts and workings of the PDPA will be examined in depth. In the fourth part of the course, practitioners from the PDPC and the private sector will provide their perspectives on this process and a holistic and practical viewpoint to the study. 

After completing this course, students will be able to use what they have learnt to obtain professional certification such as from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) and PDPC with a view to practice in this area as a privacy counsel, privacy professional, manager and/or technologist. This will prepare students for a career in this growing field, or at least provide them with the skills and knowledge when dealing with such issues as a TMT lawyer, legal counsel or even as a general legal practitioner that will possibly encounter these issues at work.","Regulatory Compliance, Regulatory Compliance, Regulatory Risk Assessment, Regulatory and Legal Advisory","Disciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - IS Related Courses, AREA - IT Solution Management Core, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Public Pol and Public Mgmt Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - Law: Law and Technology Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW.486,,,

LAW.491,YPHSL,Law and Digital Commerce,"As businesses increasingly embrace the use of technology in domestic and cross-border operations, such as blockchain technology, cloud technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) and digitalized trade documents, it is necessary for lawyers and legal policy-makers to not only appreciate the complex legal and policy issues arising from such use of technology, but to also help provide clear legal thinking and innovative ideas in resolving such issues.

This unique course aims to provide students with an opportunity to learn about and confront a selection of such issues, develop an understanding of real-world legal-policy issues and exercise skills in critical thinking and creativity to produce usable law and policy recommendations. The issues are selected based on their topicality, feedback from industry, importance to Singapore and ASEAN and a review of academic and business literature.

Students will be guided in an exploration and analysis of cross-border trade law issues relating to the intersection of commerce and technology. In the first part of the course, an explanation of the some key issues will be provided to help students understand the broader context of trade in the digital economy. Students will then be exposed to a number of issues which are confronting policy-makers and the private sector, so that they may conduct legal research and craft clear and cogent law and policy recommendations from their findings. Industry professionals will help to provide feedback and discuss students' findings and recommendations. Industry contacts in this course are likely to be from the fields of finance, technology, commerce, policy/strategy and law.

In addition to interactive learning with the course instructor (Professor Locknie Hsu), students will also receive industry and policy insights from 1-3 industry experts (who may be from the commerce and finance, technology and/or policy-making sectors).","Regulatory Compliance, Regulatory Compliance, Regulatory and Legal Advisory, International Trade Legislation Compliance","Disciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Collaboration and leadership, Innovation and enterprising skills, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Self-directed learning, Multidisciplinary knowledge",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Advanced Business Technology Major, AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Globalisation Cluster, AREA - Grad Req - Dig Tech/Data Ana (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - IS Related Courses, AREA - Law Capstone, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, RQPR - Applicable for LLB only, TRCK - Law: Law and Technology Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW.491,,,

This aspect of the course will also examine, on a comparative basis, the manner in which legislatures and the judiciary have responded to the growth of negotiation and mediation, especially in developing such processes as judicial settlement conferences, judge-led or court-annexed mediation, restorative justice, the statutory provision for mediation, and judicial 'supervision' of private justice;

Second, the course will provide an introduction to the core skills and processes of negotiation and mediation, in particular paying attention to the practice of mutual gains bargaining and negotiating in the international legal environment.

As technology develops and changes, new challenges emerge for law and policy-makers to deal with the impact that they may have on society. Existing laws have to adapt to the digital medium and subject matter, and in some cases entirely new areas of law are crafted. This course on Information Technology and the Law examines the legal issues and regulations arising out of the use of information technology in major areas of law, such as electronic contracting in e-commerce, intellectual property rights on the Internet, the domain name regime, data protection and privacy rights in relation to electronic information, torts committed online, content regulation, computer crimes and cybercrime.","Corporate and Business Law, Regulatory Compliance","Critical thinking & problem solving, Self-directed learning, Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Advanced Business Technology Major, AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - IS Management Depth Electives, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Technology & Entrepreneurship, AREA - Technology Studies Cluster, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - COR-LAW2242, RQCX - COR2226, RQCX - LGST205, TRCK - Law: Law and Technology Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW405,,,
LAW406,YPHSL,International Commercial Arbitration,"International commercial arbitration has held itself out to be a fast, convenient and confidential means of binding dispute resolution. Since 1958, the wide spread recognition of arbitration awards by different countries, the promulgation of a model law of arbitration and a growing acceptance of a uniform set of best practices has increased the profile of arbitration. This is more so in Asia than anywhere else. In a region of varied court systems, arbitration offers certainty, due process, confidentiality and a quiet resolution. Or does it?

As arbitration is consensual, almost all arbitrations arise from a clause in an agreement. The agreement itself can address a myriad of dealings from joint ventures to distributorships to acquisitions. Lawyers in all commercial disciplines need to appreciate what their clients agree to when an arbitration clause is in their document.

In this context there will be an analysis of those legal principles which enable a bank (or its customer) to recover mistaken payments, as well as an examination of the bank's liability for the fraudulent activities of third parties. More generally, there will be a consideration of the bank's responsibility as a fiduciary and its duty of confidentiality to its customer.

The second part of the course will then be devoted to the pivotal role of the bank as a finance provider. There will be a consideration of different types of loan, together with legal mechanisms that are available, or may be utilised, to secure their repayment  (for example, guarantees, set-offs, security over receivables and liens).

LAW425,YPHSL,Advocacy,"The objective of this course is to introduce students to the art of advocacy and court craft, as it is practised in Singapore. It will be practice-oriented and skills-based. The course will consists of 10 weeks of seminars and 6 practice sessions by lawyers, including SCs from 2 leading law firms. They will cover specific areas such as development of case theory, opening statements, cross-examination techniques and closing submissions. This will give the students real insight into the actual workings of litigation practice in Singapore and an opportunity to interact with and be inspired by the very best litigators in town through the practice sessions. The practice sessions will be a series of 4 ""learn-by-doing"" workshops, where the students will be asked to perform various advocacy tasks using a case study in a simulated court room environment. The seminars will focus on the following areas: 
•	Development of case theory 
•	Pleadings 
•	Preparing for trial 
•	Drafting Opening Statements 
•	Drafting Affidavits Examination-in-chief 
•	Learning Cross-examination and Re-examination 
•	Drafting Closing Submissions 
•	Ethics and Etiquette
This will give students a hands-on opportunity to practice trial techniques and strategies with the assistance of experienced and skilled trainers, who will offer constructive and practical suggestions in a supportive learning environment. Students will develop essential advocacy skills, including effective preparation and communication skills, and develop their own effective style of advocacy.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, RQCP - LAW306/LAW307, RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW425,,,

Despite its beginnings as an improbable nation, Singapore's economic success has been dependent on political stability, of which the absence of overt ethnic conflict is fundamental. This course seeks to critically examine the legal framework and policies for the management of ethnic relations in Singapore. Laws alone are manifestly inadequate in maintaining peace on hot-button issues of race, language, and religion. The course will also examine the political framework in place that complements the legal and policy infrastructure. At the end of the course, students will be better placed to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the Singapore approach to the management of ethnic relations.

In particular it will cover, in more depth than in LAW205, the formal processes available in Singapore – receivership, schemes of arrangement, judicial management and liquidation (winding up). In those contexts, the substantive policies and principles of the law will be addressed – e.g. , the pari passu principle, the concept of set-off, and the avoidance of suspect transactions entered in the run-up to insolvency. In addition, the course will consider informal debt restructurings (work-outs), and also introduce the issues and developing law relating to cross-border insolvencies. As well as providing a theoretical grounding in corporate insolvency principles, it is expected that aspects of the course will involve the participation of specialist insolvency lawyers from private practice, with the aim of providing a practical perspective. 
Although the primary focus will be on corporate insolvency, comparison will be made with the procedures and rules applicable in the bankruptcy of individuals. It is likely that before or during the period of the course the Government will publish a draft Insolvency Bill combining and amending the rules applicable to both individual and corporate insolvency. If so, the course will take those proposals into account.","Corporate and Business Law, Restructuring Insolvency Advisory, Risk Advisory","Disciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Communication, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Self-directed learning, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - ACCT417, RQSR - LAW205/LAW201_621/LGST201 with min Grade A, TRCK - Law: Corporate Transaction Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW429,,,ACCT417

The course will consist of a systematic examination of key principles and policies of foreign direct investment law, a close study of the several obligations undertaken by host state in its treatment of foreign investors, a critical examination of the compensation standards that have been developed by international tribunals, and the settlement of disputes under various investment protection agreements. The materials that will be analyzed in the course will be the BITs and the investment protection chapters in the FTAs concluded by Singapore, a few principal model BITs issued by countries such as the US, some typical foreign investment protection laws of some ASEAN countries and the decisional law of investment dispute tribunals such as the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives/IS Options, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Major, AREA - Legal Studies Major, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - LAW4008, RQCX - LAW422, RQCX - LAW458",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW432,,,LAW4008|LAW4021|LAW4040|LAW422|LAW458

The regulatory apparatus of international finance, however, still needs to catch up.  To help us appreciate as much, our study of global financial regulation will proceed in three parts:  We will begin, by way of foundation, with a series of sessions directed to several of the key dimensions of international financial regulation today.  Thereafter, we will explore the cause and consequences of the financial crises that have rocked the global economy over the last century – from the Great Depression, to the East Asian financial crisis and the recent financial crisis – and will seek to draw lessons from each.

LAW448,YPHSL,Joint Venture Law (Singapore - Indonesia),"Firms are increasingly committing themselves to global markets. Many such firms do so by associating in a joint venture which is chosen as a form of doing business for various reasons.  In the age of outsourcing, firms that are rich in intangible assets such as a brand name that has a reputation for quality or superior knowledge may be averse to the risk of dissipation posed by outsourcing. Instead it would choose to engage in a joint venture which can control the knowledge through the joint venture vehicle of which the source firm is a participant.  The surge in collaborative ventures may also be driven by considerations of access to markets, access to capital, seeking benefits from economies of scale, a syndication of risk, or access to local organizational capabilities and positional assets such as distribution outlets.

For Singapore based firms venturing abroad, Indonesia offers many low hanging fruits.

LAW450,YPHSL,International Arbitration Practice,"International Arbitration has become the default means of resolving disputes between parties from different countries. With increasing globalization, international trade, and international contracting, the number of international arbitration disputes has steadily increased--especially in Singapore, which has become a major arbitration hub. Many Singapore and international law firms have arbitration teams in Singapore—many more will form these teams in the near future to take advantage of the steady upward trend in the volume of casework in the region. Arbitration work is by definition international, peripatetic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural and spans all industries that make up international business. No two cases are the same. It is a challenging field that attracts talented lawyers from all over the world. It is an exciting time to be an arbitration lawyer in Singapore.

This course provides a rigorous ""hands-on"" practical introduction to International Arbitration with a focus on experiential learning. The aim of the course is to prepare the student to practice in the field of international arbitration. The method of instruction is through lectures, workshops, and practical written and oral exercises. The course is a ""learn by doing"" academy on an arbitration case from start to finish.  We will utilize a case study as the vehicle through which students will be exposed to advising a client on all stages of the dispute resolution process, from selecting the appropriate dispute resolution mechanism and drafting the dispute resolution clause, steps and strategies to take when a dispute arises, to working through all phases of the arbitration process till award, and post-award proceedings in courts.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives/IS Options, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Major, AREA - Legal Studies Major, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQSR - LGST101/201 Grd A- or LAW101 Grd A- or enrol LLB",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW450,,,

LAW454,YPHSL,Law and the Changing Media Environment,"This course will examine how the news media – broadly defined to include newspapers and other serial print publications, radio and television broadcasts, and Internet websites – are regulated by law and government policy in Singapore. To set the scene there will be a consideration of freedom of speech and expression and, in particular, press freedom as a constitutional concept; and how these should be balanced against countervailing public interests such as protection of privacy, reputation, and confidence in the administration of justice. This will be followed by an examination of the following topics: how the print and broadcast media (including the Internet) are regulated; defamation law as it relates to the media, particularly the public figure and responsible journalism defences; criminal offences such as contempt of court, criminal defamation and sedition that restrict the publication of certain types of content; conflict of laws and criminal extraterritoriality issues arising when material from abroad can be accessed in Singapore; and the efficacy of self-regulation in the media industry. A number of these issues will be illuminated by examining key court judgments such as Review Publishing v Lee Hsien Loong [2010] 1 SLR 52, CA, and Shadrake v Attorney-General [2011] 3 SLR 778, CA; and legislation such as the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (Cap 206, 2002 Rev Ed) and the Broadcasting (Class Licence) (Amendment) Notification 2013 (S 330/2013).

LAW456,YPHSL,Domestic and International Sales,"A large portion of the Singapore economy depends upon trade in goods.  Sales and purchases of ""things"", such as automobiles, furniture, semi-conductor chips, medical devices, pharmaceutical products, petroleum products, agricultural products, and so on are covered by the law of sales.  In Singapore sales law, which is part of contract law, is governed by the Singapore Sale of Goods Act (""SOGA"") which is essentially the same as the UK Sale of Goods Act.  Sales of goods that cross national boundaries are presumed to be covered by the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (""CISG"") to which Singapore and almost 80 countries are parties.  

This course will focus on cases and problems arising under SOGA or CISG, or both.  There are interesting differences between the statutory treatment of sales and the basic common law of contracts, and a lawyer who works in the commercial area needs to be aware of those differences.  Lawyers must advise clients about whether to choose to be governed by the CISG or to follow the ""opt out"" procedures of the CISG and have domestic law apply to a transaction.  

The course also will take note of sales law issues that have arisen in several countries with which Singapore has major trading activities and which could affect Singaporean companies.  Some attention will be paid to the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Transactions, a set of principles that incorporate, in various ways, elements of the lex mercatoria, the customary law of international sales transactions.

LAW468,YPHSL,Foreign Investment Law in China,"For many lawyers and legal advisers working in Asia, an increasingly important aspect of their work is their more substantial involvement in cross-border transactions with PRC components.  Most of these transactions are large-scale commercial transactions, and this Course will focus on those kinds of transactions.

Even amongst commercial transactions, there are many types and the work that an adviser needs to work on is varied and, in many cases, complex, difficult and growingly challenging (given the differences between two jurisdictions).  This Course focuses on a few of those transactions such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, banking finance: it is not possible in the time available to deal with all of them.

The approach in this Course is to follow a fairly straightforward transaction for a single client through from beginning to end.  It will start with the client, who has never done business in the Mainland China before, coming to the legal adviser seeking legal advice and assistance.  Then the client will decide on the type of business it wants to use, taking into account the many factors the client needs to consider.  The client will then set up the business in the Mainland China.  After that it will buy some materials and sell some products.  It will also need to raise some money for the business. Later on, it may expand its China business by merging or acquiring a target company (or its assets). Unfortunately, a dispute will arise and the client will seek advice on how to deal with it.

The aim of this Course is to enable you to be acquainted with the legal issues in regard to foreign investment projects in China and associated commercial legal transactions.

LAW474,YPHSL,International Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Practice,"Commercial transactions now frequently take place across borders. The growth of international trade has given rise to a corresponding increase in the number of transnational commercial disputes. Commercial parties desire a swift, practical and cost-effective resolution of such disputes. National legal systems were designed primarily to manage intra-jurisdictional disputes and were perhaps not particularly well-equipped to deal with cross-border disputes. 

International arbitration has provided a big part of the answer and serves as a primary if not default means of resolving transnational commercial disputes today. More recently, the courts in a number of jurisdictions have also innovated to fit into the changed dispute resolution landscape. They have established specialized international commercial courts such as in Dubai, and most recently, in Singapore as viable alternatives to international arbitration, depending on the parties' particular needs. 

Any student with interest in pursuing a career in international commercial dispute resolution needs to have a good grasp of the process of the creation of commercial law and how they are enforced through various dispute resolution mechanisms.  The objectives of the course are to equip students with a working knowledge of the Singapore International Commercial Court, as well as prepare students to practise in the field of international arbitration. Course content is roughly divided equally between international commercial dispute resolution and international arbitration. 

The part of the course on international arbitration will be focused on practical aspects of international arbitration procedure. It will be a ""learn by doing"" academy which may revolve around a case study as the vehicle through which students will be exposed to some of the more significant stages of the dispute resolution process.

LAW475,YPHSL,Transnational Business & Human Rights,"Over the last twenty years, scholars and practitioners have shined a spotlight on human rights conditions in transnational industries including oil and mining; manufacturing; agriculture; pharmaceuticals; and internet/telecommunications. Courts have increasingly had to contend with these cross-border issues. As the activities of corporations often transcend national frontiers and the consequences of such activities can be felt in a great number of States, there is increasing awareness that some form of supranational regulation of corporations is necessary in certain areas such as the protection of human rights and the environment and the fight against corruption. 

During the same period, business and human rights has emerged as a distinct field. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011), for example, define a corporate responsibility to respect human rights. In response to growing pressure to address human rights issues, some transnational companies have begun to conduct human rights due diligence and integrate human rights considerations in corporate policies and practices. 

Drawing on international standards, industry case studies, legal proceedings, the work of international organizations, and a growing academic literature, course explores the theoretical difficulties in securing corporate responsibility for human rights abuses within the framework of transnational law; as well as the practical aspects of enforcing such responsibility in international and national courts and tribunals, with a particular focus on the Southeast Asian region. ",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW475,,,

Students will be fascinated to discover that Health Law incredibly straddles across numerous traditional branches of law such as torts, contract, insurance law, criminal law and administrative law.","Regulatory Compliance: Comply with policies, procedures, and external regulations","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Ethics and social responsibility, Interdisciplinary knowledge",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Health Econ and Management Electives, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - LGST233, TRCK - PLE: Public Policy and Governance Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW476,,,LGST233
LAW477,YPHSL,Law and Psychology,"A fundamental function of the law is to regulate different facets of human behaviour.  However, the process of regulation must start off with an understanding of what is to be regulated. It is therefore not surprising that psychology – the study of human behaviour – provides a wealth of insights to the legal fraternity, be it practitioners, judges, enforcement agencies and policy makers.

This course provides, for law students, an introductory glimpse into the intersection between law and psychology. We will adopt a topical approach, where students explore different areas of the law and psychology's relevance to them each week. A sampling of the issues we will cover include:

•  mental disorders and their implications for offending behaviour and criminal procedure
•  human memory and its effects on eyewitness and courtroom testimony;
•  custody evaluations and psychological assessment in family law proceedings;
•  behaviourial theories underlying principles in tort and evidence law; and
•  how lawyering skills such as negotiation, persuasion and advocacy can be enhanced and informed by psychological research.

This course seeks to develop better practitioners for the future by giving fledgling lawyers the psychological lens they may require to make sense of practical issues that commonly arise in practice. Students will also grow to appreciate that the law does not operate in a silo, but in the context of other disciplines that contribute towards its practice, policy, institutions and mechanics.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Related Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - Law: Dispute Resolution Track, TRCK - PLE: Choice and Behaviour Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW477,,,

The course is taught by practitioners in the Attorney-General's Chambers who will examine the theory and practice in these three areas of law, including how such cases are investigated and brought before the Courts. Students will be expected to critically examine the regulatory environment; the law and the policy operating behind the law; and the role of the different stakeholders in addressing criminal offences committed in the financial sector.

Our first classes together will try to distinguish how and why this law is different from 'human rights' (a much later development (i.e. post-World War II) for the discipline), which will require consideration of some of the earliest iterations of the laws of war—such as the principle of distinction and the principle of unnecessary suffering. Students will then be introduced to some of the major legal questions of our time, for example the treatment of Taliban and Al Qaeda members at Guantanamo Bay and the entitlement to prisoner-of-war status by members of Islamic State (Da'esh). We shall also explore how public international law deals with the issue of nuclear weapons, taking the atomic attacks of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 as our lead examples, as well as the choice of targets (i.e. the increased destruction of hospitals in the Syrian conflict, as shown in The New Barbarianism). There shall be a strong reliance on actual examples of warfare—from Vietnam, to the destruction of cultural property such as the Buddas of Bamiyan of Afghanistan, through the justice for 'comfort women' or sexual slaves who suffered at the hands of Japan at the end of the Second World War to the belligerent occupation of Iraq—to explain the basic tenets of and strengths of the law but also the unique problems by trying to introduce order into chaos.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives/IS Options, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Major, AREA - Legal Studies Major, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW488,,,
LAW490,YPHSL,International and Comparative Insolvency Law,"This course seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of insolvency law from a comparative approach, with a particular focus on the law of the United States, the United Kingdom and various jurisdictions in Continental Europe, Asia and Latin America. It will be shown that, even though most insolvency jurisdictions seek to solve similar economic problems, the way to do so differs across jurisdictions. After becoming familiar with the insolvency regime existing in some relevant jurisdictions, we will analyse which factors and insolvency provisions may help create an optimal insolvency regime. In order to do so, we will take into account the economic problems that insolvency law seeks to solve, the particular features of a country, and the impact that the solutions provided by insolvency legislators may have on entrepreneurship, innovation, and access to finance. It will be shown that insolvency law is a very powerful tool to promote growth in a country. For this reason, linked to the fact that many jurisdictions want to become global centres for corporate restructurings, several countries around the globe are amending their insolvency laws. Among other proposals, we will analyse those existing in the United States and Europe, and which steps are being taken by Singapore to become a global leader for corporate reorganizations. The course will conclude with an analysis of the primary problems, challenges and solutions to deal with cross-border insolvency. For that purpose, we will analyse the features of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency, as well as some regional initiatives - such as the European Insolvency Regulation- to deal with those problems arising in a situation of insolvency in which there is an international component.","Corporate and Business Law, Restructuring Insolvency Advisory","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - LAW201_621/LAW205/LGST201, TRCK - Law: Corporate Transaction Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW490,,,

Those disputes can be resolved through many mechanisms from negotiation through to the more contentious litigation.  As commerce has become more complex so have the disputes.  This has given rise to the increasing need for expert witnesses or advisors across fields such as finance & accounting, construction, shipping, law, IT and the sciences (microbiology, geology, chemistry, engineering etc.).

This course looks at the role of experts in the dispute resolution process.  The course draws its examples from the two most commonly used expert types, being Finance/Accounting and Construction experts.  The course culminates in a mock trial where participants will have the opportunity to cross examine experts.

Despite the fact that most countries around the world provide a form of business corporation, there are considerable differences in the way corporations are owned, governed, and controlled. This course seeks to explore how companies are managed and controlled around the world, and what problems may arise from the interaction of shareholders, managers, creditors, employees, and other stakeholders. It will start by analysing the role and function of corporate governance, and why it matters for firms' access to finance and the promotion of economic growth. It will then analyse the different agency problems and corporate ownership structures existing around the world. The course will cover a variety of topics in corporate governance, including board composition, directors' duties and liability, executive compensation, and the balance of power between managers, shareholders and other stakeholders. It will then analyse how to protect outside investors from the opportunism of managers and controlling shareholders. The course will also analyse the rationale and regulation of hostile takeovers from a comparative perspective, with particular emphasis on the law of the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, China, Japan, Singapore, and Latin America. The final part of the course will be focused on the analysis of new issues and discussions existing in corporate governance, including shareholder activism, short-termism, dual-class shares, and the concentration of share ownership in the hands of institutional investors. It will then conclude with an analysis of the corporate governance challenges generated by new forms of financing such as crowdfunding and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).","Corporate and Business Law, Corporate Governance, Corporate and Business Law Application, Corporate Governance","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - LAW101/LGST101, TRCK - Law: Corporate Transaction Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW494,,,

LAW498,YPHSL,State Courts Clerkship Programme,"1.	The State Courts – NUS & SMU Clerkship Programme (""the Clerkship Programme"") is a judicial clinical programme designed to provide top law students with the opportunity to be attached to senior District Court Judges (""Supervising Judges"") and acquire experiential knowledge of law practice through direct exposure to judicial work. It is a unique course which allows law students to acquire a different perspective of legal work through personalised interaction with senior Judges, working on actual cases and experiencing legal practice in real-life settings. 

2.	In the course of the Clerkship Programme, the Clerks will be required to assist Judges with legal research and case analysis in cases involving more complex legal issues. The Clerks will experience the realities of court proceedings from observing court hearings and interacting with the Judges. From the vantage point of the decision-maker, the Clerks will get to experience first-hand the adjudication process of receiving and weighing relevant facts and evidence, assessing the credibility of witnesses, and persuasion by opposing parties. 

3.	The Clerkship Programme will allow Clerks to practise and consolidate legal skills already acquired under the core curriculum through case research, writing and analysis. Through exposure to court litigation, the Clerks will be able to hone higher cognitive legal skills through critical analysis of facts, evidence, legal arguments and persuasion, as well as to gain a unique understanding of the critical processes in fact-finding and decision-making from a judicial perspective. Through interaction with Judges and other legal professionals, such as lawyers and court staff, the Clerk will learn higher level professional skills in communication and court craft, which are critical in their future careers as lawyers. The clerkship training will allow Clerks to learn the intricacies of various processes and rules in the context of judicial administration and engage in self-learning of substantive areas of law across disciplines. 

4.	As the Clerkship Programme is intended to prepare the Clerks for life as a legal professional and takes place in a real world setting where court schedules are subject to change and other exigencies, the learning experience can be expected to be a rich and varied one. As Supervising Judges are engaged in their own professional work, the range of support that the Clerks can provide can vary depending on the types of cases that come before the Judges.

5.	All Clerks must be prepared to take ownership of their own learning and time management by capitalising on opportunities for learning, discussion and reflection. Clerks are required to find opportunities to complete the list of minimum tasks listed in paragraph 14 of this syllabus, and are encouraged to add to the list as the opportunity arises.","Conflict Resolution, Financial Crime Laws and Regulations, Legal Drafting and Writing","Disciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Ethics and social responsibility, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, RQPR - Applicable for LLB only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW498,,,
LAW499,YPHSL,Legal Commentaries for Practice (Advanced Legal Writing),"This SMU-X course aims to give SMU law students opportunities to publish legal commentaries on topical issues, hone their writing and editing skills, and learn more about the legal start-up industry. This course is a collaboration with Asia Law Network (ALN), a law tech startup which also provides practitioners a platform for publishing articles on topical legal issues <http://learn.asialawnetwork.com>. 

As a refresher on the fundamentals of legal analysis and writing, students will start with writing a case commentary on a topical CA judgment. They will then write two short legal commentaries, which will require both research and analysis. The commentaries will involve topics of practical significance, analysis of which would be helpful to practitioners and/or the general public. These topics will include (but are not limited to) those identified by ALN. 

As part of the learning process, students will work in pairs: they will review and edit each other's work (including reviewing the research and analysis conducted by their partner), and in doing so hone their own analytical and writing skills. Students will also focus on communicating their analysis in a manner which is helpful to both lawyers and non-lawyers.

Students will receive close guidance and supervision from the instructor, including frequent feedback and in-person consultations. They will also receive practical feedback from ALN on their commentaries, including the usefulness of their research and analysis. 

Students will also be able to gain insights into the legal tech industry, through discussions with ALN personnel.

At the end of the course, students will have the opportunity to submit their papers to SMU Lexicon <https://smulexicon.com> and ALN (articles may be cross-posted on both sites).

As a result, clients expect their legal services providers to engage technology in their practices and are auditing legal providers' IT systems and capabilities.  This course will explore how technology is currently used in legal practice and how its evolution will continue to shape the legal profession.

LAW4007,YPHSL,Advanced Law of Obligations,"Many prominent jurists assert a very close connection between the law of contract and the law of torts.  Some – most prominently Peter Birks – have even suggested that breaches of contract and torts comprise a single, unified legal category (wrongs). Although good reasons for this view can be identified, it is observably true that many important disjunctions between these two branches of the law also exist. 

The goal of this course is to provide an appreciation of commonalities, connections and divergencies between contract and tort law. The course aims ultimately are threefold. To provide a suitably informed platform from which we may critique: 
(i) the common claim that tort and contract together comprise a single legal category: 'civil wrongs';
(ii) certain commonplace theoretical claims about private law (such as some jurists' insistence that there be privity between the parties, and that remedies be underscored by a commitment to corrective justice);
(iii) the difference between the way in which contract and tort accommodate certain pervasive defences in the law (such as duress and limitations of actions).",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW4007,,,

Partners@WongPartnership will guide the students through each stage of the entrepreneur's journey and discuss the legal issues the entrepreneur will encounter at the different stages of building the business.   The journey begins when the entrepreneur first look at the options that are available to start a business in Singapore.  While most entrepreneurs will opt for a private limited company as the start-up vehicle, there may well be other options that better suit the business needs.  Most start-ups will then explore ways of raising funds to support the business growth, looking first to venture capital providers and then bank borrowings, before eventually raising monies on the capital markets through an IPO with a listing on the Singapore Exchange.  Life as a listed company on the SGX will be more exciting, as the entrepreneur learns to cope with stricter corporate governance standards.  Pursuing M&A opportunities as a listed company is no longer a decision that entrepreneur can make on his own accord.  A successful listed company will in turn become the target of interest by other companies or private equity buy-out funds, looking to acquire and/or take the listed company private.  Unfortunately, leveraged buy outs don't always end on a happy note; we will explore at the end of the course the scenario where the company struggles with debt servicing and going through the ensuing debt restructuring to save the business.

In this course taught by two leading experts in international economic law, one from the US and one from China, we will conduct an in-depth examination of the many interesting legal issues in the US-China economic relations.

The first part of the course will be lectures with two main modules, with one focus on international trade law and the other on international investment law. Each module will provide a critical analysis of the main issues at stake, the dynamics of the conflicts and negotiations, and how the future will unfold. 

After the lectures, the students will form groups to work on pre-assigned topics. Each group will include both SMU and UCI students. During the group work, the students are expected to engage in comparative discussions and reflections.

In addition to learning the substantive legal issues involved in the course, the students are expected to gain the following skills/benefits through this course:
The ability to understand, appreciate and identify with different perspectives and cultures, as well as more awareness on the roles and responsibilities of a global citizen;
The necessary skillsets to work in a cross-cultural environment, especially the ability to go beyond one's comfort zone and quickly adapt to different settings;

LAW4017,YPHSL,Using Dystopian Films To Regulate Against A Dystopian Future,"Dystopian fiction serves as both a warning of things to come, as well as a useful tool in planning for such eventualities. This forecasting is valuable in plotting the ethical, social, and legal ramifications of said eventualities and determining optimal regulatory oversight.

More so than other types of stories, dystopian film and television provide highly visual and memorable touchstones for society to discuss complex technological ideas. Consider the recently popular television anthology series Black Mirror, which first aired in 2011.  Many of the show's most disturbing episodes feature seemingly futuristic technologies such as devices that wire directly into the human brain and present the potential consequences thereof. Surprisingly, such revolutionary technologies are not so far off.   A great example of this convergence is Elon Musk's Neuralink Corp. which recently announced a similar device to the one in Black Mirror, the  pending ability of Neuralink's implanted brain chip to allow people to ""listen to music directly from our chips […or] control hormone levels and use them to our advantage."" 

Given the warp speed at which fiction and non-fiction appear to be colliding, there are clear teaching opportunities in employing dystopian film and television programs in the areas of pedagogy focused on the intersection between law and technology.   

This course will look to Hollywood's view of dystopia as a jumping off point to analyze the intersection between law and emerging technologies.

LAW4032,YPHSL,Law and Technology,"Law and technology are strange bedfellows. In some sense, the law may be seen as crucial piece of social technology that makes civilization itself possible. Without law, said Thomas Hobbes, life would be nasty, brutish, and short. The Hobbesian reference to automata has also been identified as one of earliest conceptions of artificial intelligence. Thus began a long entanglement between law and computing technologies. The first people to ""Code"" were lawyers, not programmers. Leibniz, famous for inventing calculus, held a doctorate in law. So too did Schumpeter, the 'father' of innovation theory.

But lawyers today are not known for technological competence. Google ""why are lawyers bad at"" and autocomplete suggests ""math"".  US lawmakers hauled Facebook before them only to explain how the internet works.  And the US Supreme Court, suggests Nate Silver, is ""allergic"" to statistics.  These are the people responsible for writing, interpreting, and in some sense enforcing the laws that govern technology.

This course aim to plug the puzzling chasm between lawyers and technologists by introducing tomorrow's lawyers to what technology is and how it is regulated by, and itself regulates, law. We will cover four key themes in particular:

1.	The History of Law and Technology
2.	Regulating The New Web
3.	Artificial Intelligence and Law

LAW4035,YPHSL,"Consumer Law, Digital Market and New Technologies","Consumer law is becoming an increasingly important area of law. The market, technology and society are constantly evolving. Therefore, the existent consumer law needs to adapt to new products, new markets, new technologies and the outcome of a rapidly globalised World. In order to conceptually capture these phenomena traditional legal techniques deployed by consumer law, need to be applied in innovative ways and often new legal mechanisms that better fit a new economic reality have to be developed. For example, the rising relevance of online market in the Covid-19 era represents a particular regulatory challenge for consumer law. Compliance with the new consumer law rules is becoming an increasingly difficult task for the businesses. This course will allow students to obtain in-depth knowledge and expertise in key areas of consumer law, whilst at the same time honing their analytical and problem-solving skills. Based on the most advanced legal thinking and taking a global, comparative and interdisciplinary perspective, students will be equipped with the critical understanding and analytical tools necessary for applying new legal concepts and practicing law in the highly complex, sophisticated and dynamic environment of current commercial reality. This is essential for anyone who wants to fully understand the intricacies of consumer law and learn how to fully apply with consumer law requirements.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Globalisation Cluster, AREA - IS Related Courses, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW4035,,,
LAW4036,YPHSL,Global Constitutionalism in a Comparative Perspective,"This course seeks to give students an introduction to comparative constitutional law. It starts with an introduction to the methods of comparative constitutional law, discussing the predominant functional method as well as more recent quantitative-empirical approaches. In a second step, we will analyze whether it is possible to identify families of constitutional legal systems. In particular, we will discuss whether the distinction between common law and civil law that is prominent in comparative private law also has value for constitutional law. The third class will deal with judicial review of legislation. We will start from the fundamental legitimacy problem that the judiciary faces when reviewing acts of the legislature and examine the different responses that constitutions have found to address this problem. The fourth part addresses the structure of government. We will not only analyze different ways how governments are accountable to their citizens, but also look at empirical evidence on the economic effects of governance design choices. The fifth part deals with fundamental rights and addresses in particular the structure of the fundamental rights analyses. In many jurisdictions, the proportionality test is at the heart of the fundamental rights analysis. We will look at how proportionality varies according to different constitutional contexts and also look at functional equivalents in jurisdictions that have not adopted the proportionality test. The final part looks at a very recent phenomenon where states are increasingly challenged before domestic courts to strengthen their commitment to mitigate climate change.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - LAW204",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW4036,,,
LAW4037,YPHSL,Employment Law and Regulations in Singapore,"Employment is an integral part of every economy and to the livelihood of most people.  The employment law landscape in each jurisdiction is unique, being shaped by a myriad of influences ranging from the government to employers, employees, unions and even prevailing societal and political views.  What are the rights and obligations of employers and employees, how do both employers and employees alike protect their own interests, to what extent does the law assist them in doing so and if not, what recourse do they have  – these are just some of the few questions that students will be asked to reflect upon and answer.

This course will introduce students to the various legal aspects of employment law in Singapore including employment related statutes like the Employment Act, Employment of Foreign Manpower Act and the Central Provident Fund Act to the law on restrictive covenants and confidential information.  The course will also examine industrial relations in Singapore and the role of the government and relevant government agencies and authorities in shaping the employment law landscape in Singapore.","Conflict Resolution, Regulatory and Legal Advisory, Corporate and Business Law","Disciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Public Pol and Public Mgmt Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW4037,,,

LAW4041,YPHSL,International Anti-Corruption Compliance Law and Practice,"To better serve clients or assist them to develop effective compliance frameworks and internal controls, it is imperative that both dispute resolution and transactional lawyers practicing anywhere in the world be familiar with the ambit of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and the UK Bribery Act. 
 
The extraterritoriality of the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act has serious consequences for individuals and corporations (including non-US / UK persons, and subsidiaries) operating anywhere in the world. The sanctions imposed by the US Department of Justice / the US Securities Exchange Commission and the UK Serious Fraud Office typically run in the tens of millions of dollars. Notably, between 2010 and 2021, the monetary penalties imposed exceeded US$15 billion dollars.

Against this backdrop, this course examines the prohibitions, rules and standards that govern transnational corruption laws and anti-bribery compliance law and practice. 	

The course will start by generally examining the ethos and expectations of the key regulators / enforcers before reviewing the FCPA and UK Bribery Act. It will also consider the importance of internal controls and the components of an effective anti-bribery compliance (""ABC"") program. We then examine the use of deferred prosecution agreements, and non-prosecution agreements by regulators. We go on to analyse case studies of instances of corruption (e.g., Siemens AG, Rolls Royce, Goldman Sachs etc). In the last part of the course, we consider the need to create and implement internal controls and ABC programs that go beyond the letter of the law (e.g., codes of ethics, social responsibility standards, and the creation of institutional culture of compliance).",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Electives, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - LAW495, TRCK - PLE: Global Studies Track, TRCK - PLE: Public Policy and Governance Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW4041,,,LAW495

LAW4055,YPHSL,"Introduction to Large Language Models, GPT and Legal Technology","Large language models (LLMs) are the driving-force behind some of the latest technology advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing's new chat search, and Google's Bard. These LLM-powered applications have demonstrated the impressive ability to produce natural, fluent text in response to user inputs on a diverse range of topics, leading to claims that this will herald another breakthrough in artificial intelligence and change how we work in ways we did not think possible. 

In this course, we will study these LLMs in detail by exploring the way they are trained and evaluating their capabilities through reviewing research papers and hands-on testing. We will also discuss the risks and concerns associated with the use of LLMs as they are being deployed into an increasing number of applications, driven largely by a combination of ease-of-use and impressive performance. We will explore how these LLMs are currently being used in legal technology and consider how they could impact the future direction of the legal profession.

By the end of this course, student should be able to:
•	Understand the fundamental concepts behind LLMs
•	Explore the various applications of LLMs in real-world scenarios
•	Evaluate the ethical, social and legal implications of LLMs
•	Develop an informed perspective on the future of LLMs and their role in shaping the practice of law

While some of the topics in the course may come across as being technical, prior knowledge is not required.

This course examines the law and practice of international commercial arbitration in these civil law countries. Topics that will be covered include jurisdictional issues, arbitrability, the validity of arbitration agreement, principles to determine the applicable law, arbitral tribunals and institutions, arbitration procedure, interim and final awards, and the court's role in relation to arbitration. Each topic covered in this course will involve a comparative study of laws and practices in the PRC, Korea, and Japan. Students will be exposed to case law relating to arbitral awards and relevant court decisions from the respective civil law jurisdictions.

Where tangible chattels are held on trust, the trust beneficiary has an 'equitable interest' in those chattels. This 'equitable interest' is a form of 'equitable' chose-in-action – a 'chose' (ie a 'thing') reducible into possession by bringing legal proceedings against the trustee. To give or sell this equitable chose to a third party, the beneficiary may do so via an 'equitable assignment'. III. One can also 'equitably assign' choses-in-action arising at common law. IV. How equitable assignment has been enhanced by statute (see s 4(6), Civil Law Act 1909) will also be examined. V.

It seeks to provide students with an understanding of the key principles in this key component of commercial law. 

The course will primarily focus on Singapore and English law – the London insurance market is traditionally regarded as the industry leader in the development of insurance law and practice. Notably, Lloyd's of London and the London Company Market insure risks placed all over the globe. As such, English law has an outsized influence in the development of insurance law and practice.

In particular, this course is designed to give students a flavour of what life is like as a transactional lawyer working on a general banking transaction. 

Over the weeks, students will be walked through the lifecycle of a fictitious watered-down financing transaction. As the transaction progresses, students will gradually be introduced to the various financing legal documents (eg, term sheets, loan facility agreements, corporate authorisations) and their key clauses. Crucially, students will also step into the shoes of lender's counsel and be given several opportunities to ""hold the pen"" – students will be tasked to take instructions from their clients and draft/review certain financing legal documents. Finally, students will participate and lead an all-parties call to iron out the outstanding issues blocking the transaction from closing.

Through this course, students will have the opportunity to both gain insights on transactional lawyering, as well as learn practical skills that will better prepare students to transition to their upcoming lives as practice trainees and junior associates.

This transition is claimed already to be in train in many common law jurisdictions – it is 'the direction of regulatory travel' – and the technological management regulatory paradigm now seems particularly salient in light of myriad advances in computation and AI. Drawing and interrogating the contrast between the two paradigms will allow us to see and evaluate the assumptions and benefits of each as well as their disadvantages.

LAW4083,YPHSL,The Illusion of Rationality in Decision-Making: Insights from Psychology,"We like to think of ourselves as rational beings, making decisions based on facts and sound principles. Such critical thinking skills are integral to many vocations, including the legal profession in which advice is rendered based on rigorous analysis of law and facts. However, research from social and cognitive psychology has shown the illusion of rationality in human choices. Our decision-making is routinely affected by cognitive distortions including biases, judgment shortcuts, memory distortions and perception limitations. Consequently, many disciplines, including economics and policy making, have acknowledged that we are not as rational as we would like to believe.

Whether you are a future lawyer, business consultant or someone who will need to solve problems in your career, you will benefit from understanding the impact of cognitive distortions on decision-making. Harnessing psychological insights will make you more effective in risk prediction, weighing and choosing between solutions, and interacting with clients and other professionals.

Drawing from the instructors' experience in psychology, neuroscience, law and dispute resolution, this course offers a robust evidence-based framework to understand the impact of the illusion of rationality on decision-making within the legal profession.

Simply put, the rule of law embodies the fundamental principle that every person and institution is subject to the same set of laws. It also regulates and moderates power, especially in the public sphere. 

Moreover, since independence, Singapore has also conscientiously evolved its own approach to governance with the rule of law, itself adapted to fit local needs and priorities, and yielded commendable outcomes including for the economy and business, the social fabric (including housing, healthcare and social safety nets), racial and religious harmony, law and order, international relations and more. This non-ideological, outcomes-based approach interacts with concepts such as constitutionalism, the separation of powers, and judicial review. 

The course will also consider criticisms of Singapore for its manner of observance of the rule of law, which the Government steadfastly maintains that there is no universal under¬standing of what the rule of law is and requires. It insists that the rule of law is subject to the social, economic and security imperatives facing Singapore.

The study of the subject will also provide students with an excellent opportunity to observe, evaluate and critique developments in the law as it responds to the fast-changing and dynamic environment of the world of commerce.","Corporate and Business Law, Regulatory Compliance, Corporate and Business Law Application","Disciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Communication",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Core, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: Open from BOSS 2, RQCX - LGST101",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW101_601,LAW.485|LAW102_602|LAW201_621|LAW202_622|LAW302_632|LAW303_633|LAW306|LAW307_637|LAW4001|LAW4003|LAW4013|LAW4014|LAW4019|LAW403|LAW4049|LAW4050|LAW4058|LAW4069|LAW4071|LAW413|LAW414|LAW415|LAW417|LAW418|LAW421|LAW423|LAW424|LAW427|LAW428|LAW431|LAW433|LAW434|LAW435|LAW437|LAW439|LAW440|LAW441|LAW442|LAW443|LAW444|LAW447|LAW448|LAW449|LAW450|LAW456|LAW460|LAW478|LAW494|LAW660|LGST201,,LGST101

It is important to realise, though, that Singapore's legal system and that of its constituent laws are not mere offshoots of the English. Many substantive and institutional features as well as rules and practices within the system have changed over time. 

Broadly speaking, topics include Singapore's legal history, the sources of law in Singapore,  constitutional and institutional framework of the Singapore State, disruptions to and the regulation of the legal sector. Time permitting, a trip to a State institution may be organised.

The main objectives of the course are, firstly, to familiarise students to various key aspects of the Singapore legal system; and, secondly, to equip candidates with a set of fundamental legal knowledge to springboard to other courses within the core curriculum.","Professional and Business Ethics, Regulatory Compliance, Legal Drafting and Writing","Disciplinary knowledge, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Critical thinking & problem solving, Self-directed learning, Ethics and social responsibility",PNP - Pass/Fail,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Core, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Singapore Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: Open from BOSS 2, TRCK - PLE: Public Policy and Governance Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW108_608,LAW109_609,,

In the middle part of this course, the question of ownership and transfer of moveable property at common law and in equity will be considered with particular attention to the difficulties posed by intangible moveable property in the form of intellectual property rights as well as other choices in action. The final part of the course examines the creation of security interests over immoveable and moveable property and the problems relating to determining the priorities of competing security interests. Comparisons may be drawn with alternative systems of property law, e.g. the scheme of security interests set out in the Uniform Commercial Code and the treatment of property generally in the American Restatement on Property.","Corporate and Business Law, Taxation Laws, Regulatory and Legal Advisory, Professional and Business Ethics","Ethics and social responsibility, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Understanding of sustainability issues, Innovation and enterprising skills, Critical thinking & problem solving, Disciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Core, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - LAW101, RQCP - LAW102, RQCP - LAW105_605, RQCX - LGST210",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW202_622,LAW.485|LAW4003|LAW4013|LAW4014|LAW414|LAW660,,LGST210

The course introduces and explains the fundamental principles of Conflict of Laws. When problems arise in the relationship or transaction and the parties seek to resolve their disputes, the conflict of laws addresses four large issues: (1) when will a Singapore court exercise jurisdiction to adjudicate? (2) What can a Singapore court be asked to do to prevent a foreign court from adjudicating? (3) When will a Singapore court apply something other than the domestic law of Singapore to determine the claim? And (4) what effect will a foreign judgment have in Singapore? Given the cross-border nature of the issues, the position in other jurisdictions (for example, the applicable rules in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) will also be considered for the purposes of comparison with Singapore law.","Corporate and Business Law, Legal Drafting and Writing, Risk Advisory","Disciplinary knowledge, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Self-directed learning, Critical thinking & problem solving, Communication",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Law Core, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - LAW101/LGST101/LGST201",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LAW302_632,LAW407,,

In relation to the law in this area, Asia has only more recently begun to catch up on the laws to deal with these issues. For example, Singapore has released many new and amended laws within the last decade alone that relate to infocomm developments. More recent amendments include changes to the Electronic Transactions Act of 2010 relating to e-contracts, e-signature and intermediary liability; the enactment of the Personal Data Protection Act in 2012 relating to data protection, the do-not-call registry and the Spam Control Act; changes to content regulations, specifically the class licensing regulations in 2013; the Protection from Harassment Act of 2014 and amendments to the Copyright Act in 2014 and 2016. In 2018, the Singapore legislature is expected to produce more new laws to deal with the fake news phenomenon and electric payment systems as well as in the areas of cybersecurity, electronic transactions and data protection.

LGST103,YPHSL,"Governance Through Law In Singapore: Institutions, Jurisprudence, And Values","This course aims to introduce PLE students to how law operates in Singapore. We will explore the role of law in Singapore in the management of both public power and the sphere of private dealings between persons. This will be done through a study of the various sources of law and their nature; the legal institutions and the relations between them; and foundational principles and values.

We will begin by exploring the concept of law and the ideals of constitutionalism, democracy, the rule of law, and the separation of powers – all of which pertain to the ways in which power is defined and limited by law. Besides studying what law is, we will study tools and concepts which have some degree of formality but are not law, such as policies and decisions by those who hold discretionary powers.

Having inquired into these ideas, we will go on to explore the various institutions of the state and their roles, as well as the values that animate them. This is important because law does not put itself into action; legal institutions breathe life into laws by interpreting them, executing them, and serving as sites of contestation as to how they are to be interpreted and executed. We will discuss matters such as different modes of lawmaking and their relative advantages and disadvantages; the role of the state in controlling its own power; and the limits to law as a means of governing society. Finally, we will apply all this knowledge by focusing our attention on a few discrete areas of law as case studies.

While this course will focus on Singapore, comparisons will be drawn with other legal systems, particularly the UK's, when appropriate.","Regulatory Compliance: Comply with policies, procedures, and external regulations","Disciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Communication, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Legal Studies Electives, AREA - PLE Core (Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Singapore Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LGST103,LAW4031|PLE401,,

It deals with a web of different interests and the rights and obligations of a number of stakeholders. As such it is a highly complex structure and the most regulated of all business entities. 

This course will cover the main body of laws that regulate the operational aspects of companies embodied in the Companies Act. Where appropriate and relevant, these laws will be considered from the different perspectives of the various interest groups in a corporate structure. The course will also attempt to acquaint the student with the primary issues that are raised in the management of companies. Topics include current issues in corporate governance, the external regulation of corporate matters, the duties of corporate managers, directors and other officers, the law and practice of meetings and legal issues relating to corporate restructuring. The difficulties relating to transactions with other parties, which are peculiar to companies, will also be covered, including corporate contracting and insolvency. The course will also touch upon the ongoing law reform in this area.

Upon the completion of this course, the student should –
- understand the legal framework within which companies operate;
- appreciate the different interest groups within the corporate framework;

The rules relating to its current and future value, how it may be securely transferred from one party to another and its very definition all depend on law. The course is vital for students with an interest in real estate transactions, its development, investment and financing.

The primary topics covered include the nature of real property, contract and property torts, interests in property, development and construction, the rules relating to securitisation and taxes affecting property.

Armed with some basic knowledge, entrepreneurs should be able to better structure their businesses, avoid common legal pitfalls, and identify potential problems, and take appropriate actions, both before and after the problems arise. A failure to understand –at least rudimentarily –the impact of the legal landscape and certain legal developments on business transactions often has dire consequences.

This is an introductory course designed to help acquaint students –who may be future business owners or managers –with the legal environment within which businesses operate and the common legal issues one may face when doing business in Asia, with a particular emphasis on Singapore. The course will entail not only classroom teaching and learning, but will also include invaluable sharing sessions guest speakers from various relevant fields, as well as field trips to legal institutions and/or offices in Singapore.

A substantial part of the course will be dedicated to exploring, at a general level, various aspects of laws pertaining to doing business, with an especial focus on business organisations and commercial transactions.

With cross-border business dealings being the norm instead of the exception, an understanding of the implications of contractual clauses in international contracts, and of the avenues for the resolution of international disputes, also become essential.

Because business relationships with commercial parties are primarily governed by contract, an understanding of how contracts work is important. Basic principles of contract law (e.g. the making and performance of contracts), as well as laws applying to specific situations (e.g. the sale of goods and services), will be taught in brief. Students will also be introduced to the law of torts and will, in particular, learn the essentials of the very pervasive tort of negligence, and the often-misunderstood tort of defamation.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Not Applicable, RQPR - Open to NG only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=LGST234,,,

The routinization of practices, obsolescence of such routines and dominant logic that may be misaligned with changes in the environment subject large firms to great difficulties in innovating. Further, revenue cannibalization with existing products and the politics of allocating scarce resources away from established, competing product divisions afflict how new ventures are created within large corporations.

MGMT.235,LKCSB,Sustainability Management and Governance,"This course provides an introduction to environmental sustainability and human development issues, and the means of framing, analysing and solving such problems. As environmental and social problems mount around the world, firms have become more attuned to the need to devise new products, services and strategies, and to communicate these to a variety of stakeholders, even as they cooperate with them.Environmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed and developing nations alike. Typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but more recently, global climate change has become the primary issue for many. In general, sustainability issues often consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions. The course will focus in particular on businesses' role in causing and addressing sustainability problems and on how they moderate their impacts. An important part of addressing the sustainability of firms is the employment of various concepts and frameworks that help incorporate the sustainability perspective into firms' strategies and operations. To help characterize firms' sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course will cover specific managerial tools and frameworks. The primary focus will be on strategy and business models that support change and its operationalization, but the course will also illustrate the role that ""greening"" other business functions play in the sustainability of the firm, including those of marketing, supply chains, and financing. The course will review core management frameworks to help non-business major students become familiar with more sustainability-specific frameworks, practices and concepts to be covered. These tools are not only means for improving a firm's sustainability performance, but also support its transparent and effective reporting. Representative examples of sustainability measurement standards will be introduced and their potential impacts in advancing corporate sustainability will be discussed. The course will also reflect on the general role of innovation in all of this. Technology issues covered include the role of information technology in addressing poverty, and solutions that reorganize the industrial system (e.g. renewable energy policies, and industrial ecosystems or industrial symbiosis, i.e., industries that incorporate recycling loops at regional levels).","Futures Thinking, Integrated Problem-Solving, Strategic Thinking, Sustainability-focused Methodologies, Systems Thinking","Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Ethics and social responsibility, Understanding of sustainability issues",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Asian Studies (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - Business Core-Biz in Context(Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Communication Management Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Global & Regional Studies, AREA - Globalisation Cluster, AREA - Grad Req - Sustainability (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Public Pol and Public Mgmt Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, AREA - Sustainability Management Core, TRCK - Accounting Major: Sustainability Accounting Track, TRCK - Finance Major: Sustainable Finance Track, TRCK - PLE: Distribution and Justice Track, TRCK - PLE: Public Policy and Governance Track, TRCK - PLE: Sustainable Futures Track, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT.235,MGMT386,,
MGMT.236,LKCSB,Managing Strategic Change and Digital Transformation,"To achieve superior performance in an increasingly dynamic and uncertain global business environment, companies in every industry must create internal capability to harness strategic change for sustainable competitive advantage. However, companies that are able to strategically change their entrenched ways of doing things and then reclaim leading positions are the exception rather than the rule. With the industry 4.0 upon us and fast advancement in digital technologies, firms in many industries would find it even more pressing but challenging to build the managerial capabilities to cope with the digital transformation that will reshape the business landscape tremendously for the future. Against this backdrop, this course discusses how companies can effectively manage the strategic change and digital transformation that will significantly impact the way the business is configured for competitive advantage. Besides the internal managerial challenge, the course also emphasizes that companies must cope with strategic interactions with different industry players to create value collectively and continuously. With respect to digital transformation, the course discusses digital concepts and technologies such as omni-channel, platforms, eco-systems, blockchain, IOT, AI, and cloud computing etc. that impose both challenges and opportunities for strategic change management in the increasingly technology-based, internet-based, and data-based business contexts.","Digital Strategies, Futures Thinking, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Strategy Planning","Collaboration and leadership, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Interdisciplinary knowledge",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Digital Business Core, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - IS Related Courses, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, AREA - Technology & Entrepreneurship, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCL - 2CUs:FNCE/ACCT/MKTG/COMM/OBHR101/OPIM201/MGMT102",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT.236,,,
MGMT.239,LKCSB,Play in Design and Cultural Invention,"This course will explore how 'play' can enhance creative design processes to promote innovation and invention. Play was borne out of not only human desires for leisure and frivolity, but cultural and biological needs such as learning and community bonding. Recently, it has been observed that inventors in history have conceived of new ideas and products, even technological inventions, in a playful manner (Johnson, 2016). Playful invention processes could be serious experimental (and risky) efforts, or playfully frivolous ones. The course will analyze and apply creative and inventive processes, with the focus on how the mind can explore more widely and inventively by becoming less self-conscious and critical through play. 

Playful invention facilitates creativity by blending ideas together from different domains, causing 'forms' to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to reshape not only leisure, but other domains and culture itself. This creative blending helps cross-fertilize domains with new ideas. We will examine how inventors 'playfully created' in different domains such as narrative, visual arts, space (including architectural space), and games. While most of the cultural domains covered relate to historical and current popular culture, we also pay attention to specific local and 'globalized national' cultures.

At least half of the course focuses on the actual practice of techniques that are related to the conceptual study of domains and thinking processes. We will adapt the design thinking process to incorporate additional brainstorming techniques (including domain-specific ideation techniques) and user-centered prototyping while removing the 'project client' typically seen in design thinking projects. In addition, we will illustrate and practice how to design using domains as lenses into the design of forms related to those domains. 

A significant part of the course will involve a project to design an innovative experience or other 'form' using these creativity and design techniques. In-class (or online) group exercises and projects will be used to demonstrate and practice these techniques, and full class attendance is expected in order to participate in these group exercises and group work.","Creative Entrepreneurship, Futures Thinking, Futures Thinking, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Systems Thinking, Systems Thinking, Values Thinking (Normative)","Disciplinary knowledge, Disciplinary knowledge, Innovation and enterprising skills, Innovation and enterprising skills, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Entrepreneurship Cluster, AREA - General Education, AREA - Global & Regional Studies, AREA - Globalisation Cluster, AREA - Innovation & Entrepreneurship Major Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, AREA - Technology & Entrepreneurship, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT.239,,,

Please note that the course has a heavy theoretical basis. This involves building a deeper understanding of how digital media products like games come about and work. We do this by understanding how creativity, culture, technology, and processes (e.g. product development and organizational) are integrated into these media. This will help to appreciate industry and business issues. In particular, the course discusses the central role of creativity in these selected industries, as well as the factors that influence or constrain this creativity. We draw most of our examples from the video game industry, and to some extent, ""digital"" media such as social media, but we will also make comparisons with other industries such as IT, design, film, and animation.

Ethnic Chinese from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia are actively involved in these massive transformation and integration processes. The course will scrutinize their role as well as some of the (culturally biased) misperceptions about their business conduct. The degree, to which their extensive business networks succeed because of ethnic characteristics, or simply because of the sound application of good business practice, is a key issue that will be discussed throughout the course. Based on various corporate case studies and a multi-disciplinary explanatory framework, we will assess the role, characteristics and challenges of Chinese entrepreneurship and business networks in the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia in an era of global market expansion.","Business Acumen, Business Ethics and Values Management, Diversity and Inclusion Management, Management Decision Making, Organisational Design","Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Asia Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Asian Studies (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - Business Core-Biz in Context(Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Entrepreneurship Cluster, AREA - Grad Req - SG & Asia Studies (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Intl & Asian Studies Major, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT.304,,,

The 21 economies of the largest trans-Pacific grouping, Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), account for nearly half of global trade. The region comprises not only the world's 'factory floor' but also its most important sources of services, technology and investments, and final goods markets,"" writes Peter Petri, an international trade economist.   Yet despite the much celebrated economic progress of the region and the potential to be reaped from it, there are clear strains and risks resulting from geopolitical and economic trends which impact businesses that operate here. 
 
This course consists of a set of core lectures which will introduce students to: (a) economic, political and socio-cultural theories and frameworks for understanding the context of business in the Asia Pacific region; and (b) the application of international business theories and frameworks to understand the decision-making processes of companies investing in the region. Course participants are expected to apply theories and frameworks to assess business environments of specific Asian economies.  Participants are expected to analyse and make presentations about issues and challenges that are relevant to companies operating in large emerging economies such as China, India, Taiwan, and South Korea but also other economies such as Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.","Global Perspective and Global Thinking, Global Perspective and Global Thinking, Integrated Problem-Solving, Integrated Problem-Solving, Strategy Planning, Systems Thinking","Collaboration and leadership, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Communication, Critical thinking & problem solving, Critical thinking & problem solving, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Asia Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Asian Studies (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Global & Regional Studies, AREA - Global Asia Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - MGMT205, TRCK - Public Policy, Devt, & Mgt Track (Business)",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT.312,,,MGMT.205

This course immerses you in user-focused innovation, teaching design principles from Stanford University's Design School/IDEO framework. You'll learn to create new products, services, experiences, and business models that truly resonate with users. Design thinking is by now known as a widely accepted and impactful way for organizations to innovate. Real world organizations ranging from startups to banks and governments employ design to improve their customer experience and organizational performance. The course is divided into four main aspects, all interconnected but separately emphasized: (1) human-centred design principles (e.g. empathetic user research, brainstorming, prototyping and testing), (2) the product or service to be designed (3) mindsets, attitudes and behaviors and (4) design contexts. Design contexts encompass the dynamic environments of humans and businesses. Increasingly, they include societal and sustainable concerns. Learning in the course will be hands-on, highly interactive and deeply engaging – through class interactions, team exercises, and a team project.  This course has benefited both students and clients in a win-win learning environment. Each semester, we have worked with clients from different industries ranging from multi-nationals to small & medium enterprises, government agencies, start-ups and non-profit organizations. Past clients were surprised and delighted with the innovative prototype solutions designed by our student teams. Students also benefited from gaining invaluable experience using design concepts to deliver value to clients, learning from client's feedback and exceeding their client's expectations.","Change Management, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Integrated Problem-Solving, Systems Thinking, Values Thinking (Normative)","Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Critical thinking & problem solving, Ethics and social responsibility, Innovation and enterprising skills, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Understanding of sustainability issues",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Advanced Business Technology Major, AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Entrepreneurship Cluster, AREA - IS Related Courses, AREA - Innovation & Entrepreneurship Major Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, AREA - Technology & Entrepreneurship, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - Public Policy, Devt, & Mgt Track (Business), TRCK - Strategic Management Major: Entrepreneurship Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT.318,,,

Different countries have different systems of capitalism and deal with this relationship in very different ways.  Because of these differences, specific systems and practices of corporate governance differ greatly around the world and in Asia. These differences, however, have been under pressure, as capital, management, and business practices become more global. Indeed, many Asian countries have revised their corporate governance system that is more consistent with global rules and expectations of investors who invest globally.   

This course aims to make participants aware of the key issues that are related to corporate governance in especially the Asian context by examining corporate governance practices in various Asian countries and comparing them with non-Asian models, specifically the US and Germany.

The course also familiarizes students with how best to present their market validation information and the initial outlines of their business and revenue models on social platforms and to early-stage investors.

The course will guide students in the process of developing and market-testing new venture ideas. Students will work in teams, and each team will receive a grant of $700 towards prototyping and market testing their new venture idea. Also, mentors will give the team feedback on their market testing process. 

Student teams (3 tor 5 students per team) can be preformed before the course or can be formed in the first three weeks of the course. If you have an idea but lack team members, or you lack an idea but would like to join a team visit this web page https://smu.sg/1lq to post your ideas and seek team members or views ideas and to join originators of ideas as team members. If you are interested in the course and want to find team members please send an email to adamequek@smu.edu.sg with the header 'Entrepreneurship Practicum"".

The student team business idea should be scalable, i.e., the aspiration of the student team should be to have at least 10 employees or $1 million in revenue within five years. If the business is a social entrepreneurship, a similar metric for social impact as appropriate will be encouraged.  Student teams, as pre-formed, will remain the same for the duration of the course. Any disagreements within a team will have to be resolved by the team members themselves.

For those graduates who choose a start-up or SME, there is also a government initiative to encourage more Singaporean firms to establish operations overseas so it is important to understand the challenges and process of doing so. Accordingly, this Capstone course integrates content drawn from practice and research on establishing a business overseas and managing a multinational, as well as, an X-Culture SMU-X experiential exercise with a real company so the student: 
 
1.	Understands the topology of differences (cognitive, cultural, nation state, institutional, business systems, market economies, economic maturity, and geographic) that exists, particularly, among countries in Asia, and must be accommodated within an internationalised business model as SMEs/MNCs establish operations outside their home country.

2.	Builds upon their prior courses, particularly business strategy, to understand the process of formulating and operationalising a strategy to internationalise towards foreign markets, as well as, the considerations and trade-offs when executing those steps. This will include an understanding of the roles and management interactions of locals versus expatriates, as well as, among host country subsidiaries, regional offices, and corporate headquarters. Emphasis is applied to understanding the strategic advantages possessed by a multinational; their ability to transfer such advantages from its home to host markets; as well as, the capacity of corporate headquarters to absorb new knowledge from its foreign operations in order to sustain and enhance its engagement within Asia. 

3.	Experiences what it is like to work in a MNC by applying a cross-disciplinary approach as a member of a global cross-cultural team. After all, reading a textbook does not allow a true appreciation of the reality of international cross-cultural business collaboration – one must experience it! You will apply both the course content and your accumulated academic knowledge at SMU in providing recommendations to a real-life SME as to a new market entry strategy (or similar assignment) encompassing market selection, entry method, marketing and operational considerations. As a participant in this global X-Culture initiative the SMU student will work in teams drawn among 5,000 students from 150 participating universities within 40 countries around the globe. After the successful completion of the exercise, in addition to the normal SMU grade, students will receive a X-Culture certificate, a performance report, and a recommendation letter reflecting your performance. The best teams will also be invited to the X-Culture Global Symposium held in July each year.

Consistent with SMU's experiential and formative teaching pedagogy, there will be three short quizzes throughout the term to promote greater knowledge retention (there is no final exam).

Such an approach applies equally to social enterprises because although causes make great narratives on entrepreneurship, they do not necessarily create sustained impact, not without enforcing key tenets of governance & sustainability. Separately, understanding the role of high-growth ventures and socially-oriented ventures in society enables each venture to contribute more successfully. It focuses the student entrepreneur on the strategic need to balance innovation with governance and sustainability in building a resilient enterprise.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Entrepreneurship Cluster, AREA - Innovation & Entrepreneurship Major Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT.344,,,

However, engaging in multiple roles also has benefits for individuals and organizations. Drawing especially on current academic research and global organizational practices, students are provided with a broad overview of related topics by exposing them to a variety of theories, concepts, findings, and unresolved issues within this area.

MGMT232,LKCSB,Business Consulting,"The SMU-X course ""Business Consulting"" is jointly offered by SMU and the University of St.Gallen. It is designed to allow students to translate classroom knowledge into professional experience. It is a unique oppor-tunity to learn more about consulting services and apply theoretical knowledge to a real business project. The core focus of this class rests on a group work built around a real world business project offered by one of our corpo-rarte partners. For each session (G1 and G2), we are collaborating with more than twelve different corporate partners with each student group benefitting from an exclusive relationship to their own corporate partner. The corporate projects cover different industries and different topics. Students are invited to share their preferences with which corporate partner (and thereby in which industry or on what topic focus) they wish to work and gain experience. 

This SMU-X course is a combination of advanced in-class learning and practical interaction with the business world via project work and guest lecturers who work/have worked with major consultancy companies such as McKinsey, BCG, or Bain. The lectures introduce the world of consulting by teaching the basic steps and tools used during the consulting process. You will learn how consultants frame, analyse and solve problems and how they present their solutions to their clients. You will obtain tools and frameworks to reduce complexity and structure a project. Sev-eral mini cases and lived situations with your corporate partner will help you to develop an understanding of how to approach a business project and manage the relationship with your corporate partner as a client. Guest lectures will provide you with industry insights and hands-on experiences about the day-to-day business of a consultant.

The unique opportunity to explore, learn, and directly apply competencies in a real life, multidisciplinary, team-based consulting experience with a company/organization is the distinguishing feature of this course. You will be working in teams for (large) corporations or smaller startups, acting as student consultants working on real challenges the organizations presently face. The solutions you develop will be presented to the senior management of the compa-nies. In previous semesters, our corporate partners included DBS (banking), Adidas (sports apparel), WWF (nature conservancy), Nestlé (nutrition), SingPost (logistics), Lufthansa (airline), CapitaLand (real estate), Sygnum (fintech), Lazada (E-commerce) and many more.","Business Analytics, Business Performance Management, Creative Entrepreneurship, Global Perspective and Global Thinking, Integrated Problem-Solving","Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Critical thinking & problem solving, Critical thinking & problem solving, Disciplinary knowledge, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Self-directed learning, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only, TRCK - Public Policy, Devt, & Mgt Track (Business)",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT232,,,
MGMT237,LKCSB,Corporate Strategy,"This builds on the course 'Strategy'.  Corporate strategy is the pattern of decision-making that determines a firm's goals and objectives, produces principal policies, defines the range of business to pursue, and pertains to the overall plan for a diversified firm.  A firm's corporate strategy acts as both a catalyst for and a constraint on the strategies of its business units.  If the business strategies do not support the firm's corporate strategy, synergy becomes impossible.  Therefore, this progression reinforces the inextricable link between business strategy and corporate strategy, with cases of business integration, strategic alliances, corporate diversification, and mergers and acquisitions.  Drawing on these factors, the major objective of this course is to help student to understand: 1) conditions under which different types of corporate strategy have the potential to create (economic and social) value, competitive and corporate advantages; and 2) organizational and managerial systems that must be in place in order to realize this potential value creation.","Business Performance Management, Global Perspective and Global Thinking, Integrated Problem-Solving, Strategy Planning","Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Critical thinking & problem solving, Ethics and social responsibility, Innovation and enterprising skills, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Resilience, Self-directed learning, Understanding of sustainability issues",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives/IS Options, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Major, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCC - MGMT102",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT237,,,

As we look to understand why organizations do the things that they do, we need to understand the people at the top. It is their experiences, abilities, values, connections, and other dynamics that influence their strategic choices that guide the direction of the firm. We will examine individual leaders (What can we learn in contrasting the leadership of Apple vs. Samsung?), leadership teams (What composition of a top management team works best when comparing companies such as Petronas and BP?), and board composition (What can we learn from the governance structures of Yahoo! and Google?). Whether it is a Fortune 100 company or a small start-up, the individual executives, top management teams, and the governing bodies (board of directors) make an impact on the outcomes of the firm.

MGMT242,LKCSB,Corporate Sustainable Product and System Design,"Companies increasingly seek to be more sustainable, but many firms struggle to operationalize the concepts within their organizations and supply chain, or to translate theoretical concepts into practical value for themselves and their customers. Sustainability practitioners must not only help develop (i.e., design) and sell a sustainable product or service, but an entire mind-set, and where necessary, to devise changes in business models and operations. The course will guide students, working in teams, through a development process involving market and strategic assessment, positioning of the product (including its sustainability attributes), customer-centric design, and business model innovation. This will in turn lead students to develop value propositions and marketing, which will be presented in a final pitch session to the client's representatives. The primary methodology will consist of design thinking techniques, which will be broadly used and adapted to the sustainability context. Phases of design include the understanding of candidate consumers' (users') needs by qualitative means, creation of basic product concepts and prototypes, and the testing and validation of prototypes with users. Implications will also be drawn for the client's business model. Note that the course may be more time-intensive than a content-based or normal SMU-X course, as it centers on a project with a methodology (design thinking), but also involves content on sustainability and business, and involves some use of analytical techniques such as secondary market research (e.g. assembling of data on consumer segment numbers). Note that the data and analysis may change depending on the client involved. As an example, a past class client was a multinational nutritional supplements company interested in servicing Asian markets with a sustainability value proposition. Future clients will be different firms.","Futures Thinking, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Integrated Problem-Solving, One or more business functions that are affected by digital technologies, Systems Thinking","Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Critical thinking & problem solving, Ethics and social responsibility, Innovation and enterprising skills, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Resilience, Understanding of sustainability issues",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Grad Req - Sustainability (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, AREA - Sustainability Management Core, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT242,,,
MGMT245,LKCSB,Overseas Project Experience (Digital Business Transformation across Asia Practicum),"A recent HBR report revealed a daunting 87.5% average digital transformation failure rate. This high failure rate could have been attributed to factors like inability to navigate the digital transformation initiatives through uncertainties and continuously reinvent themselves. Consequently, business leaders are fervently seeking new avenues for growth, be it through market expansion or a profound recalibration of their digital business strategies.This course will allow students to focus on the role of digital marketing, combined with other digital tools to help Southeast Asia businesses to transform their marketing & business strategies and design & test digital business strategies to improve their competitiveness and business performances in the digital age. It hones students' problem-solving skills and prepares them for the complex regional business environment today.Let's set our sights on Malaysia, a key economic contributor to the ASEAN region. While Malaysia's 2024 GDP per capita (purchasing power parity) of US$34,072 places it as the third richest country in Southeast Asia, its digital economy is its most dynamic growth engine. The country's prime industries include manufacturing, oil and gas, and services, but it is the rapid expansion of the digital sector that presents significant opportunities. These growth opportunities align perfectly with a focus on online retail:•	Explosive growth in e-commerce: Malaysia's e-commerce market is projected to reach US$8.79 billion in 2025, driven by a growing preference for online shopping and an increase in smartphone and internet penetration. Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2030) of 7.54%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$12.64bn by 2030.•	Expansion of online retail beyond the Klang Valley: There is a major opportunity to increase regional market penetration and brand visibility by expanding online order fulfillment across West Malaysia to cities like Ipoh, Penang, and Johor.•	Development of digital and social commerce: The rise of live-stream selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Shopee Live, and Lazada Live offers a direct channel to reach a wider, younger, and more digitally engaged audience, driving immediate conversions and building customer relationships.Malaysia is well-positioned to take advantage of these growth opportunities and become a leader in the ASEAN digital economy.In addition to the traditional industries, Malaysia has a flourishing digital economy. The country is home to a number of start-ups and tech companies and is attracting significant foreign investment, particularly in the e- commerce and fintech sectors. This vibrant ecosystem provides a strong foundation for online businesses. The government's focus, through initiatives like the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), is to boost digital transformation, empowering businesses to leverage technology. This environment is highly favorable for live-stream selling, as it supports the adoption of new platforms and technologies that enable direct engagement with consumers.Overall, Malaysia is a dynamic and growing economy with a bright future. The country has a young and digitally savvy population, a favorable business environment, and a rapidly expanding e-commerce landscape. This makes Malaysia an ideal market for an online retail business focused on digital sales channels and regional fulfillment. By capitalizing on live-stream selling and expanding delivery networks, the business is well-positioned to become a major player in the Malaysian online retail space.","Digital Technology Adoption and Innovation, Digital Transformation, Integrated Problem-Solving, Interpersonal (collaborative), Strategic Thinking","Multidisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Resilience, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Asia Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Asian Studies (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Digital Business Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - IS Related Courses, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, RQCL - 2CUs:FNCE/ACCT/MKTG/COMM/OBHR101/OPIM201/MGMT102, RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT245,,,

Significant challenges faced by firms across industries is the rapid advancement of digital technologies, the emergence of Industry 4.0 and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. To achieve superior performance and sustainable competitive advantage, organizations must proactively recognize and address these factors. 

Digital transformation of industries not only reshapes the business landscape but also introduces new risks and opportunities, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. Protecting sensitive data and information from cyber threats becomes paramount in this context.

In essence, the Business of Fun is about creating and managing environments that bring joy and entertainment to people, while also being commercially successful and sustainable. 

This new course offers an interdisciplinary perspective of the business of fun based on an in-depth exploration of selected key business aspects that are critical for the successful development, management and operation of theme parks and major tourist destinations. Students will gain insights into how these varied organisational and business elements drive the success and sustainability of the tourism and entertainment industries.

Key topics include:
- Sustainable Destination Planning: Analyzing case studies of leading theme parks and tourist destinations from an interdisciplinary perspective to understand strategic planning processes, including market analysis, innovation, and operational efficiency while balancing sustainability and commercial objectives.
- Guest Experience Management: Sustainability is critical in crafting meaningful guest experiences to ensure that visitors have a memorable and enjoyable experience. This involves aspects such as sustainable customer experience, excellent customer service, park layout, queuing systems, and the overall atmosphere.
- Human Capital in Service Business Operations: Understanding the role of workforce planning, talent development, and employee engagement in creating memorable visitor experiences. Emphasis is placed on talent attraction, upskilling and customer service leadership training, as well as ESG onboarding and performance management to build a skilled and motivated team.
- Sustainability and Stakeholder Engagement: Examining methods for effectively identifying and managing relationships with diverse stakeholders, including government entities, local communities, suppliers, business partners, and guests/visitors. Exploring strategies for integrating sustainability practices and community involvement into destination management, ensuring long-term viability and positive societal impact. Students will learn why effective stakeholder management is vital for aligning interests, enhancing operations, maintaining a positive brand image, innovation, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

MGMT315S,LKCSB,Global Megatrends: Opportunities and Challenges in Asia,"Megatrends describe data sets that provide us with macro-perspectives spanning over 5-30 years that may have profound implications on business values as well as for scenario or strategic planning processes. Although cause & effect relations are typically ambiguous and interdependent, they offer useful insights for the external and internal strategic analysis that often lead to revised business models, disruptive innovations and differentiated market positions.
This course helps students to understand the developments of globally evolving data patterns in 5 key domains: Ecology, Society, Economy, Geopolitics and Technology. Their implications will be discussed in an Asian context. We will contrast findings, practices and lessons learnt for future Managers operating in Asia when analyzing the effects of e.g. resource scarcity, societal stress, demographic change, migration, globalization as well as the economic system. A particular focus will be assigned to the rise of China and its geo-political implications on its Asian neighbours. Further, we will explore developments in key technology areas (e.g. artificial intelligence, biotech, nanotech, cyber security and space exploration).
In particular, we will debate implications on Singapore's transition into a knowledge-, innovation- and service based economy as an example to contrast initiatives in other Asian Megacities, such as Shanghai, Jakarta or Mumbai. Special topics on ""Asian Cultures"", ""Finite System Thinking"", ""Non-linear Behaviour"", ""Risk Mitigation"" and ""Venture Capital in Asia"" complement the course. Trends are internalized through examples and an Asia-related, desktop-based research project to ascertain a solid understanding of ongoing debates.

Some of these processes include innovation, development, manufacturing, services, internal and external processes.  The ability of managers to define, measure, improve and control processes is a key skill set and, combined with leadership, can enhance the success of a firm.  

In this course, students will develop a combination of practical tool knowledge and project management skills to effectively change and improve important processes.  Students will also gain a strong theoretical and practical understanding of six sigma deployment and will have the opportunity to achieve SMU Six Sigma ""Greenbelt"" certification.  Students will learn the DMAIC methodology (Design, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) and apply it in real projects.  These projects will be sponsored by SMU, local SME's and MNC's.

MGMT323,LKCSB,"Sustainable Growth in ASEAN: Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia","At the end of 1945, the areas bordering the Straits of Malacca were facing recovery from wartime destruction and the sharp decline of colonial rule.  Indonesia, the largest and most geographically widespread, in 1945 was the first to become independent.  Formed in 1948, the Federation of Malaya became independent in 1957.  The city state of Singapore broke off from Malaya and became independent in 1965.  At this point, these three post-colonial countries were at somewhat similar levels of development (although the British had treated Singapore as an urban center and a major port -- not an agricultural resource).  All three were low income countries with per capita GDP ranging from $56 in Indonesia, $333 in Malaysia to $516 in Singapore.  Indonesia and Malaysia possessed significant natural resources, whereas Singapore (now cut off from Malaysia) was bereft even of water.  Over the past fifty years, the political and economic choices made in the three countries have varied, and their growth trajectories diverged.  Today, per capita GDP varies greatly:  Indonesia, $3,491; Malaysia, $11,307; and Singapore, $56,284 (World Bank data).

These three countries have pursued different pathways which to some extent can be explained by economic drivers, but also by government policy choices with regard to inclusive growth.  The course will consider this in the context of business in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, and will study it from multiple perspectives:  government, corporate/family business, and social impact. To examine this in a one-week timeframe, we will focus on the development of infrastructure, real estate (housing), education and health care.
 
Resource-rich environments attract investors, but managing today in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia where governments are sensitive to issues of competitive and strategic sustainability, raises challenges.  Having moved from low income status to low middle-middle income status, Indonesia and Malaysia face the challenge of avoiding the ""middle-income trap,"" the situation where developing economies' convergence to the development frontier comes to a halt once their income per capita reaches a middle-income level.  In contrast, Singapore surmounted that challenged, but now as an advanced market economy, it faces the challenge of a small, high wage country (5.5 million): the need to innovate to remain competitive at this level.",Business analytics,Disciplinary knowledge,PNP - Pass/Fail,"AREA - Asian Studies (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Global & Regional Studies, AREA - Intl & Asian Studies Major, AREA - Political Science Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Sustainability Management Electives, RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only, TRCK - PLE: Sustainable Futures Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT323,,,

Under the third Sino-Singapore flagship project, Singapore and China are collaborating on the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative - New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor (CCI- ILSTC) as part of the BRI partnership. The CCI-ILSTC links the Belt (the overland Silk Road Economic Belt) and the Road (the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road) via rail and sea, which makes Singapore a key node on the BRI.

MGMT340,LKCSB,Understanding Chinese Culture and Business Environment,"The SIE6011A-MGMT340 Understanding Chinese Culture and Business Environment program comprises some of the most economically significant Chinese cities located in the southern parts of China. This program is designed to develop students' appreciation of the nuances of China's business practices in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and the Shantou Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in South China. It explores the various unique aspects of China's history, culture, society, value system, business practices, and its implication to doing business in this tectonic economy.

The course seeks to understand the knowledge and behaviours necessary to successfully meander through China's business environment, encouraging the student to take a truly local perspective in dealing with dynamic management issues in this diverse eco-system. It emphasizes how the variables of politico-socio-cultural practices interact with other national and international factors to affect managerial processes and behaviours, and illustrates current developments and trends. In addition, the growing competitive influence of e-commerce will also be considered. The highlight of the course is its emphasis on experiential education – interaction with government representatives and senior business practitioners.

The scope of the coursework includes assessing China's unique business eco-system (political, economic, legal), appreciating China's leadership, understanding various aspects of doing business in China, learning Chinese etiquette, fostering successful relationships (the importance and the art of relationships), and getting a glimpse of China's economic future development.

MGMT342,LKCSB,Organisational Aspects of Sustainable Innovation,"This course initiative rests on the assumption that there is a powerful synergy between 'sustainability' and 'innovation' in business and society. The term 'sustainable innovation' refers to the creation of new market space, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability concerns. Just like general innovation, sustainable innovation goes way beyond incremental improvements of products, services or processes. The challenge is to proactively embrace risk management and sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) aimed at aligning (novel) business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to create and capture new value. If managed well by results-oriented, socially aware sustainability leaders, sustainable innovation results not only in greater effectiveness at (intra)organisational levels but also helps to create a cleaner, healthier, fairer (and hopefully more stable) world as envisaged by the circular economy. The urgent need for sustainability has never been greater as evidenced by rapid population growth, pollution, (toxic) waste, plastic accumulating in our oceans, limited natural resources, climate change etc. This course will introduce students to the managerial discipline of innovation management with particular reference to examples of 'good' / 'best' sustainable innovation practices adopted by both local and international organisations such as City Development Limited (CDL), Banyan Tree, Sustainability Center Freiburg (launched in 2015 by the University of Freiburg in cooperation with five Fraunhofer research institutes), Henkel BeautyCare (whose Social Plastic Ecosystem in partnership with the Plastic Bank social enterprise is aimed at stopping ocean plastic and simultaneously providing opportunities for people in poverty), Procter & Gamble's Tide Eco-Box (which contains less packaging, 60% less plastic and 30% less water than the current Tide press-tap) and many more.","Environment and Social Governance, Integrated Problem-Solving, Public Policy Instruments for Sustainability, Stakeholder Governance, Sustainability Management","Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Collaboration and leadership, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives, Ethics and social responsibility, Understanding of sustainability issues",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Grad Req - Sustainability (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Public Pol and Public Mgmt Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Sustainability Management Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT342,,,

The stakeholder theory, the role of coalitions and the tools for public policy implementation will be used in the analysis of campaign outcomes.

Value co-creation is an integral performance outcome in digital platform ecosystems. In developing their digital strategies, leading companies in these systems increasingly aggregate and analyze data from both e-commerce activities and media content consumption to gain a multifaceted understanding of their customers, and to develop deep knowledge about media, entertainment, and e-commerce. As tech titans like Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba, Tencent, and Bytedance redefine the DMEEE landscape in Singapore and Southeast Asia, other ecosystem players including media firms, entertainment firms, manufacturers and retailers are presented with the challenge of developing their own digital strategies to thrive.

MGMT348,LKCSB,Family Office Management Work-Study Elective,"Asian entrepreneurs, tycoons, and affluent families are preparing to hand over an estimated S$2.6 trillion of business and wealth assets to the next generation over the coming decade. Many are setting up family offices to facilitate this succession planning and wealth transfer. 

Family offices are privately owned entities that manage the private wealth and other affairs of the family including philanthropy, education, and estate planning. In Singapore, family offices are required to have at least $10 million of assets under management (AUM), with many more than $100 million in AUM. Beyond managing the family wealth, the family office also supports the family's vision and legacy, and helps to support important transitions in ownership, leadership, and wealth. 

Singapore has gained prominence as the preferred base for family offices, with their numbers doubling to 400 in 2020 as compared to the year before. This trend is expected to continue. Family offices by nature are private, closely held entities. However, with the phenomenal increase in the number of family offices, there is a corresponding spike in demand for professionals familiar with managing the family office. 

The BFI Family Office Management Work-Study Elective is a collaboration with family offices and their advisors that will provide students with the opportunity to undergo a 5-month extended internship programme in a partner company. Most family offices are led by family principals and staffed by small teams of senior professionals with decades of experience. 

Hence, the work-study elective presents valuable opportunities for students to take on a broader range of responsibilities and to learn directly from senior management, compared to junior internships at a larger corporate organization. 

The BFI Family Office Management Work-Study Elective involves an internship locally, where students enrolled will work for at least four days each week at the host company and take courses on campus for up to one day each week for up to five months.

While undertaking this elective, students may enroll in up to 2 course units (CU) of courses, as long as there is no timetable clash with the internship requirements.

MGMT350,LKCSB,Overseas Entrepreneurship Work-Study Elective,"The importance of entrepreneurship to the economy is intuitive. More formally, numerous independent studies from credible sources have spoken at length about this. A quick search across the internet shows that the benefits of entrepreneurship include but are not limited to the following: accelerating economic growth, promoting innovation, promoting social changes, promoting research and industrial development, and developing and improving existing enterprises. Start-ups and small businesses also have a disproportionate impact on job creation, accounting for 64% of new jobs and contributing to 20 percent of gross job creation. , , , , 

In Singapore, a survey in 2012 as part of a Global Entrepreneurship Monitoring study indicates that 21.4% of people in Singapore intend to start a company in the next three years, ranked second among OECD countries.  This indicates the great interest for entrepreneurship in Singapore alone. Beyond this, the trend for entrepreneurship investment in China, India, and Southeast Asia is also encouraging. Both from the input (number of graduates and family business) as well as from the demand (number of deals and capital invested by angel investors and Venture Capitalists along with the amount that governments invested as limited partners).  

The importance of entrepreneurship, however, goes beyond job creation. It provides an ideal setting to train and equip individuals with skills they need for the future. While the future always seems uncertain, McKinsey, one of the leading management consultant firms in the world, has suggested that cognitive capability, interpersonal skills, and self-leadership are critical part of it. These are all skills that entrepreneurship is rather uniquely positioned to train.","Global Perspective and Global Thinking, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Integrated Problem-Solving","Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Resilience, Self-directed learning, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",PNP - Pass/Fail,"AREA - Asia Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Entrepreneurship Cluster, AREA - Innovation & Entrepreneurship Major Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Strategic Management Electives, RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MGMT350,,,

MKTG101,LKCSB,Marketing,"The course introduces Marketing as both a professional and an academic discipline.  As a profession, marketers identify consumer needs, determine which target markets to serve, and develop an optimal product, pricing, promotion, and distribution strategy that best satisfy consumer needs, relative to competition. These decisions—product, price, promotion, and distribution—flow from a rigorous analysis of the constantly evolving market environment and consumer needs (for example, the recent rise of ethical, sustainable, and socially responsible consumption). Marketers serve a vital role in the long-term success of all organizations, profit-oriented as well as not-for-profit, small as well as large. Academically, marketing is a multi-disciplinary field involving the concepts, theories, and methods used to understand exchanges and long-term relationships between buyers and sellers. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, videos, individual and group assignments, and case analyses, the course is designed to cover the fundamental concepts and principles of this challenging field.  It is a required course for marketing majors, which complements the theories and skills taught in many of the other majors at SMU.","Brand Management, Channel Management, Consumer Behaviour Analysis, Marketing Communications Management, Marketing Plan Development","Multidisciplinary knowledge, Interdisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Ethics and social responsibility",GRD - Graded,"AREA - 2nd Major Only - Entrepreneurship, AREA - 2nd Major Only - Marketing, AREA - Business Core (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - Business Core (Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - IT Solution Management Core, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCX - ACM212",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MKTG101,MGMT.236|MGMT.305|MGMT102|MGMT245|MGMT386|MGMT389|MKTG.220|MKTG.221|MKTG.229|MKTG102|MKTG103|MKTG204|MKTG205|MKTG207|MKTG208|MKTG210|MKTG212|MKTG214|MKTG215|MKTG216|MKTG217|MKTG218|MKTG225|MKTG227|MKTG228|MKTG231|MKTG233|MKTG234|MKTG311|MKTG313|MKTG315,,ACM212

As the world of business transforms into a global knowledge-based economy, value creation for customers is primarily shaped through provision of services, rather than goods. In most economies, services account for more than 50% of the economy. This course is designed for undergraduates seeking to develop a deeper understanding of services. Strategies used by successful services marketers to overcome problems unique to service industries like banking, health care, financial services, insurance, hospitality, consulting, telecom, media, and IT services will be discussed.

Over the years, consumers and audiences have become more media and advertising savvy. The rise of the ""Information Society"" and the perspective of media convergence is revolutionising the whole communication environment. And Advertisers are now more aware regarding accountability, cost efficiency and R.O.M.I. (Return On Marketing Investment). The result is a dramatic evolution in Advertising and the industry has to face new and challenging scenarios.

This course aims to prepare students to develop and implement state-of-the-art Advertising strategies that engage, influence and persuade target audiences employing a sustainable balance of creativity, effectiveness and efficiency. The course will be a ""hands-on"" learning experience where students work as teams doing research, target analysis, media evaluation and creative development.","Advertising Management, Consumer Behaviour Analysis, Digital Marketing, Marketing Communications Management, Marketing Plan Development","Critical thinking & problem solving, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Marketing Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - MKTG101, TRCK - Culture, Org & Behaviour Track (Business), TRCK - Marketing Major: Retail & Svc Mgmt Track",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MKTG205,,,

A central challenge in the course is to conduct a group project in promotion that demonstrates application of useful concepts.

MKTG207,LKCSB,Marketing Strategy,"Marketing strategy is the means by which a company creates a sustainable competitive advantage by providing superior customer value. To do this, a company optimizes the use of scarce resources as it leverages its strengths and takes advantage of market opportunities.

This course builds upon the foundational principles acquired in MKTG101 by providing a more in-depth understanding of how different marketing concepts fit together. It also aims to develop students' ability to develop a strategic plan, beginning with an analysis of situation, the selection of the right target segments and the right competitive advantages, to the formulation of a coherent set of marketing actions that contribute to the company's goals. A problem-solving approach is taken in the course, with the view that an effective solution to a marketing problem requires a thorough understanding of the consumer/market and of the competitive context.

This course is suitable not just for marketing majors, but anyone who has an understanding of basic marketing concepts and who wishes to have a good understanding of how strategic marketing can contribute to a company's success.","Advertising Management, Digital Marketing, Strategy Planning, Sustainable Practices","Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Ethics and social responsibility",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives/IS Options, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Marketing Major, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - MKTG101",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=MKTG207,,,

The two concepts are overlapping that one often says that ""marketing needs selling"" and ""no selling can take place without marketing."" The instructor will guide students on how the sales function is operationalized in different kinds of marketing organizations as the scope can vary from consumer and retail marketing, trade marketing, services marketing, and business-to-business marketing. Students will cover this course under two parallel themes–the process of selling and the role of the professional sales team through the process of sales management. Students will learn the underlying body of marketing theory that underpins the study of sales management and personal selling. You will also learn some of the important principles of effective presentations related to sales proposals to organizational customers. A key delivery for this course would be for students to develop a case scenario to simulate a sales strategy involving target prospect calling, sales presentation and negotiations leading to sales conversion.

Instead, the best marketers understand that customers do not behave rationally and that even the best plans are constantly fine-tuned.

The popular mantra applies here: ""all elements of the marketing mix have the capacity to communicate."" Major changes primarily impacted by the use of the digital media as well as the global impact of messaging in marketing needs to be strongly factored in today's study of marketing communications. Ultimately, the end outcome of IMC is its impact on the brand in terms of its ability to elevate brand awareness, brand recognition and ultimately brand preference and loyalty.

MKTG234,LKCSB,Sustainable Marketing,"Much of marketing in the last half century has been about the single-minded satisfaction of consumer needs and wants. The key to success is thought to lie in thoroughly understanding what these needs and wants are and ensuring the best fit between what is offered as a product and what is desired. This market-led approach, unfortunately, is myopic in its neglect of other stakeholders, such as the environment and the community. This course takes an alternative perspective, premised on climate change, deterioration of the marine ecosystem, and social inequalities as realities. It first examines how current consumption patterns are harming the environment and communities. It then delves into what responsible consumption entails and how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable.

MKTG236,LKCSB,Digital Marketing Strategy,"In the era of new digital technologies, the focus of marketing has shifted. It's no longer about selling a product or service but engaging with customers through relevant content and encouraging interactions that positively impact business. This advanced course recognizes this shift and is designed to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of digital marketing, incorporating established and emerging strategies.

This advanced course is delivered using an SMU-X learning approach. SMU-X is an experiential learning framework that calls for students to take on real-world challenges by collaborating on projects with corporations, non-profits, and government organizations. The framework represents a paradigm shift in the traditional teaching and learning approach, from teacher-centered to students taking ownership of their learning.

The course offers a comprehensive blend of theory, empirical analysis, and practical examples to reinforce key concepts related to digital marketing. Students will apply their knowledge to develop a digital marketing strategy for a real industry partner. We will collaborate with a real industry partner and offer consultancy services to recommend relevant digital marketing strategies for a real business problem.

With engaging seminars, case study discussions focusing on global brands, insights from industry experts with rich international business experience, and hands-on real business projects, students will sharpen their problem- solving skills to tackle real-world business problems through interdisciplinary approaches and activities. They are guaranteed an interactive learning experience that is informative and relevant to working for global businesses.

Today, with the increasing popularity of social media and Web 2.0 / 3.0, HR practice continues to evolve; a recent development is the newly coined role of Chief HR Officer (CHRO).

Using outsourcing and best practices, the HCM and Talent Management approach frees up the time and resources of senior HR professionals so that they can move from operational HR issues to focus on strategic HR issues and HR transformation.

OBHR232,LKCSB,Employment Law for Business Professionals,"As a business professional, a firm understanding of employment law is crucial for driving business outcomes. At the minimum, this ensures that your legal obligations surrounding employees are always met. Yet, its importance extends far beyond legal compliance – employment law considerations are also vital in informing strategic management decisions across key areas, from workforce planning (e.g. cross-border recruitment, restructuring/downsizing), ESG performance (e.g. managing diversity and inclusion, workplace safety, grievances), risk management (e.g. protecting company assets, managing dispute resolution), stakeholder relations (e.g. managing unions), to expansion into new markets (e.g. navigating local laws).

In this regard, this course is designed to impart to you an understanding of the employment law regime in Singapore. You will acquire an awareness of the employment landscape and key employment-related laws in Singapore. You will learn to identify and address key issues that impact employment and affect employment relationships. You will develop a working understanding of the key 'buckets' of employment law, from hiring, managing, terminating, to post-termination matters. You will develop an appreciation of how these legal requirements not only apply to daily operational issues, but also how they form the crucial basis for higher-level strategic management decisions. You will hence study requirements and issues relating to the following non-exhaustive list of topics:

•	Hiring employees, including looking at fair hiring guidelines on non-discriminatory and 'locals-first' policies in Singapore; and hiring of foreign manpower; 
•	Managing employees, including looking at employers' and employees' rights and obligations under law; employment contracts, including what they comprise and how they govern an employment relationship; and workplace safety and health matters, an area under significant scrutiny following COVID-19;
•	Terminating employees, including whether and how employees can be dismissed from the workplace; how retrenchment exercises work; and the respective pitfalls; 
•	Industrial relations, including how they affect the hiring, managing and termination phases of the employment relationship; and
•	Post-termination concerns, including confidentiality and non-competition/solicitation obligations.  

Through the course, you will be exposed to the different sources of employment law, including legislation, case law, tripartite guidelines, advisories issued by the Ministry of Manpower, amongst others. You will understand how the tripartite relationship between the Government, employers and unions work and affect these. In this respect, this is a very grounded course, which will require you to develop a clear understanding of the employment legal regime and then think practically on how to anticipate, manage, and navigate employment issues, as well as apply them to broader organizational objectives. 

This course will be especially pertinent to students aspiring to careers as a HR professional or in management. In either role, a firm grasp of employment law means that you will be able to proactively identify and flag potential issues, hence becoming a valued strategic partner to your employer. The course will also be relevant to students who are interested in consulting work or business in general.","Employee and Labour Relations, Knowledge Management, Management Decision Making, Strategic Human Resource Management","Multidisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Communication",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Legal Studies Related, AREA - Org Behaviour & HR Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - OBHR101/OBHR201, TRCK - Culture, Org & Behaviour Track (Business)",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=OBHR232,,,

This course is designed so that you will learn concepts useful for understanding power and influence, and ways of analyzing power dynamics in organizations. Even more importantly, the course encourages you to think about and develop your own personal path to power (which can include, of course, a path away from power), as well as to develop your skills in exercising power and influence—to make you more comfortable with ""managing with power."" The course will also introduce difficult ethical questions associated with the use of power and influence, and challenge you to define for yourself what constitutes the ethical exercise of power and influence in your life.

The materials and ideas that form the basis for much of the course have been selected because they challenge many aspects of conventional wisdom or the taken-for-granted assumptions that many people hold about the sources of success and influence. The ideas and concepts are, however, well grounded in empirical literature in the behavioral and social sciences. If some of the readings or discussions disagree with your ideas or cause you to feel uncomfortable, that discomfort is part and parcel of the learning process.","Career Coaching, Career Framework Design, Employee and Labour Relations, Team Effectiveness Management, Work-Life Harmony","Critical thinking & problem solving, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Ethics and social responsibility, Self-directed learning, Resilience",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Org Behaviour & HR Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 4 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - PLE: Choice and Behaviour Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=OBHR234,,,

No professional entering the field can expect to succeed in his or her career without a solid understanding and hands-on practice of analytical tools to help in making people decisions.

The organizations that will win the ""war for talent"" will be those which are better at identifying and keeping key talent, motivating high performance, developing and promoting staff and predicting future people needs accurately. HR professionals need analytics to address these challenges. For exam-ple, linking pay-for-performance has been a dogma of management, but recent research shows that most incentive plans do not produce the desired behavior, and that pay, in fact, has little correlation to business results. To succeed in the business world, it is imperative that HR provide data-driven answers and insights on how to implement and execute strategy through the people in the organization. The course provides students with practi-cal, hands-on approaches to connect HR policies and practices to business performance. You will review key statis-tics and finance concepts, such as ROI and people productivity; become familiar with available tools such as Workday and Tableau to complement Excel and others; discuss data collection, clean-up and warehousing; prac-tice building descriptive and predictive models; and get hands-on experience in applications for workforce planning, recruitment, compensation, training, career planning and turnover.

This course explores the business issues in the design and operation of international transportation systems and underlines their strategic importance to firms and the economy. It draws upon the disciplines of operations management, decision analysis and transport economics to present a holistic view of the theories and practices of transportation management.

Today the international shipping industry is responsible for 90% of world trade.  Shipping is the lynchpin of the global economy. Without shipping, intercontinental trade, the bulk transport of raw materials, and the import/export of affordable food and manufactured goods would simply not be possible.  In fact, the standard container boxes are the bits and bytes that flow in today's international trade network. Shipping logistics catalyzes the international supply chain management which deals with the management of physical goods (raw materials, components, finished products), information (orders, status, contracts), and financial flows (payment, credits, etc.) in a network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. 

This course examines the strategic role of shipping in global supply chains, and is an elective course which combines lectures, readings from the latest industry news, and case discussions. It exposes students to some real-industry managerial and business issues, useful conceptual frameworks, and practical analytical/quantitative models to equip them with the strategic logistics skills and the handles necessary to understand current developments in the logistics management of international shipping, as well as in the broader context of global supply chain management.",Business Intelligence and Data Analytics,Disciplinary knowledge,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives/IS Options, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Operations Management Major, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - OPIM101, RQCP - OPIM201, TRCK - Finance Major: International Trading Track, TRCK - Maritime Economics Concentration",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=OPIM315,,,
OPIM318,LKCSB,Sustainable Operations,"The objective of this course is to study how companies use their operations to improve environmental (and social) performance and contribute to business success at the same time. Many companies have started doing so by integrating sustainability into their operations. A focus on reducing environmental impact not only allows these companies to comply with increased regulations but also to reduce their costs, to improve the quality of their products, and to enhance the reputation of their brands. In addition, a new brand of companies is going beyond simply reducing negative externalities and actively tries to create a positive impact on the world.

In this course, students will learn how citizens, governments, customers, and employees are creating pressures for more sustainable development and how operations managers are responding to these pressures with principles and frameworks such as waste reduction, pollution prevention, and product stewardship. Through the course, students will study specific tools and concepts such as life cycle assessment (LCA), design for environment (DfE), take-back legislation, green manufacturing, green purchasing, remanufacturing, recycling and by-product synergy.

OPIM324,LKCSB,Global Supply Chains,"Global Supply Chain refers to the cross-border organization of the activities required to produce goods or services and bring them to consumers through inputs and various phases of development, production and delivery (International Labour Organization). As global trade is dependent on global supply chain, companies make investment decisions to globalize, setting up production facilities overseas and sales offices beyond their domestic market. The key aspects for companies embarking on global Supply Chain involves cross-border sourcing, overseas production, global planning and international distribution, where the various components for a final product could be sourced from different parts of the world, and manufactured at one or multiple locations and have them distributed to different markets. 

Managing a global supply chain is also no longer about driving down cost, but it is how companies can maintain their competitiveness and global supply chains has never been more challenging and disruptive in the current environment of pandemic and geo-political tensions. In addition, e-commerce has also changed the design for global supply chain as well. This course provides students with a practical lens and frameworks regarding global supply chain. Students learn the key concepts on global supply chain management, together with special topics on maritime logistics, technology and green supply chain that affects the development of global supply chain.

Clearly, suppliers can have great impact on a firm's total cost and help in this differentiation process. Increased levels of outsourcing and offshoring make correct selection of suppliers and their quality, along with development of relationships between suppliers and producers, more crucial than ever. Whatever the supplier provides, the effective organization needs a robust system to procure the correct goods and services at the best possible price for the organization. Once the organization has made the decision to procure goods and services from another organization, both organizations must clearly define the parameters of the relationship. This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the impact that sourcing and supply management has on the success and profitability of firms in today's business environment.

OPIM342,LKCSB,Operational Risk Management,"All organizations bear operational risks in order to achieve their objectives. Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss from operation failure.  Compared to other types of risk, such as credit, underwriting, and innovation risk, operational risk is perhaps the most fundamental and significant one. Why? Operational risk is highly asymmetrical in nature, because of the potential for very large losses due to extreme events (though these are usually few in number). Precisely because extreme events are so rare relative to other risk types, they are very difficult to assess. For organizations motivated by profit, a net positive return is required by shareholders. Operational risk therefore is a key concern of both internal and external stakeholders. 

The course will give students an overview of which operational risks are prevalent in various industries and what tools and techniques can be used to identify, quantify and control operational risks. Besides learning the basics of probability and statistical theories, students will become familiar with the risk analysis framework and will conduct a risk analysis using either Oracle's Crystal Ball software or @Risk from Palisade.

This course facilitates this understanding by discussing crucial questions such as why states go to war, why some states have become democratic while others have not, how does culture affect politics, and why various countries are ruled in such different ways.","Comparative Political Analysis, International Relations, Political Economy, Public Policy Analysis, Security Studies","Multidisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Understanding of global and Asian perspectives",GRD - Graded,"AREA - 2nd Major Only - Political Science, AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - General Education - Arts, AREA - Law Related Electives, AREA - PLE Core (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - PLE Core (Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Political Science Core (Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Psychology Core (Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - SOSC Core (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - Sociology Core (Intake 2019 onwards), ENRL - SS Enrolment: Open from BOSS 2, TRCK - Public Policy, Devt, & Mgt Track (Social Science)",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=POSC003,PLE401|POSC401,,

Most significantly, distance and borders have become less of an obstacle to production, trade and the movement of money than ever before, a set of changes that is usually summed up by the term 'globalization'.  While the gains from globalization have been considerable, it has also yielded a number of problems and raised several critical issues.  The aim of this course is to examine the causes, correlates, and consequences of globalization as they relate to political economies.  We will also ask more specific questions such as the changing role of the state in the face of globalization, the maintenance of order in an increasingly complex global economic system, and the use of political power for national economic gain.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives/IS Options, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Globalisation Cluster, AREA - Intl & Asian Studies Major, AREA - Political Science Major, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - Public Policy, Devt, & Mgt Track (Political Sc)",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=POSC106,,,
POSC108,SOSS,Mass Media and Public Opinion Research,"The mass media constitutes an important sphere through which we can understand our complex political and social world. Why does the media focus on certain issues, give voice to particular actors, and frame stories in particular ways? And consequently, how does the media affect public opinion and behavior. Does the media foster understanding, insight, and hold the powerful to account, or does it spread discord, misinformation, and maintain power hierarchies? These are the kinds of questions that students can find answers to in this project-based research design course. During the course students will learn how to write a rigorous empirical research paper and develop the methodological skills to survey public opinion and systematically code media content. After studying how to plan a content analysis and public opinion survey, students will work in groups and write a research proposal on a topic of their choosing. Potential topics are wide ranging. For instance, they could relate to elections, identity politics, migration, protest, conflict, as well as economic, business, environmental, health, or educational issues. Students then choose to design a survey or a content analysis. For the survey, students develop a questionnaire plan to gather public opinions on the media or preform a survey experiment to understand the impact of media. Students doing a content analysis will develop a codebook to code newspapers, TV, film, social media, or the web. After analyzing their unique data, student projects culminate in a presentation and an original research paper of approximately 9,000 words.","Academic Communication, Collaborative Research, Political Communication, Research Methodology, Theory Application","Multidisciplinary knowledge, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Grad Req - Dig Tech/Data Ana (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Political Science Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Psychology Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Sociology Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - PLE: Choice and Behaviour Track, TRCK - PLE: Public Policy and Governance Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=POSC108,POSC401,,

The course examines a variety of autocratic, democratic, and transitioning political systems including militarised rule, monarchies, single-party regimes, two-party systems, and multi-party democracies through real-life contemporary case studies.  In each case, we also consider how international linkages shape different countries' political systems.  We then consider which factors have been crucial to some governments better developing the capacity to get things done effectively and efficiently.

Japan was the first non-Western country to industrialize and to establish the democratic institutions. However, unlike most Western democracies, Japan maintained a mixture of democratic procedures, one-party dominance, alliance with U.S. military, high-level of economic growth, and social security from 1955 to 1993. Since to early 1993, many of mainstays of the previous system have collapsed and new institutions have established: coalition government, electoral reform, the bubble economy, etc. Following the experience of 'Japanese miracle,' the second half of the twentieth century has seen South Korea transformed from an impoverished, war-ravaged nation to one of the most successful economies in East Asian region. This has been accompanied by a political transformation from a military authoritarian regime to a vibrant democracy.

The first component of the course examines the concept of security through the lens of International Relations (IR) theory. It considers existing disagreements about the causes of war and conditions of international conflict and cooperation. The following weeks cover topics ranging from the UN Security Council, nuclear non-proliferation, civil war, and peacekeeping. For each topic students will be introduced to relevant case studies and critically engage with how, why, when, and to whom these issue areas matter.

Globalization, privatization, and changing ideas about the roles of business and government have blurred this division. In this new world, corporations increasingly deliver essential services and meet basic public needs, exert heavy influence over public policy and find that their consumers and investors hold them directly accountable for their effects on the environment and on human rights. This course examines how business, government, and society are responding to the changing landscape and explores the options that leaders now face, from rethinking business models to changing notions of governance.

POSC218,SOSS,Global Political Economy,"Globalization is often associated with intensified cross-national flows of capital, commodities, and labor that elude state control and integrate local economies into global networks of production and trade.  This module examines the manifold dimensions of the global economy along three theoretical axes. First, the specific historical form of the global economy under study is ""capitalism,"" understood as not only an economic system of material production, distribution, and consumption but also a political order of power, authority, and legitimacy – in other words, a global political economy. Second, in analysing capitalism, we adopt a long historical view that traces the emergence of its fundamental logics and global expanse back to the eighteenth century. Third, we pay special attention to political and legal frameworks other than the nation-state, especially early-modern colonial empires, modern imperialism, and their institutional and ideological legacies that have endured into the post-war international regimes of production, trade, and development.

The aim is to provide a perspective on the political and historical dimensions of the global economy that is as multi-disciplinary as possible. Lectures and readings present material from international relations, economics, political science, history, sociology, anthropology, and geography. Although concepts and theories from economics and international political economy are central to this module, this is decidedly not a course in either international economics or the politics of economic relations among states. It is an investigation into a wider variety of forms and facets of politics as they pertain to the wide range of actors participating in the global economy.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Globalisation Cluster, AREA - Political Science Electives, AREA - Politics, Law & Economics Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, AREA - Sociology Electives, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, TRCK - PLE: Distribution and Justice Track, TRCK - PLE: Global Studies Track",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=POSC218,,,
POSC219,SOSS,Political Theory,"What are the ideal ways to arrange our political institutions? What are the ideal relations between our society and ourselves? What does ""ideal"" even mean here? Moreover, in a world where there always seems to be a regrettable contrast between the lofty ideal and the nasty real, how have different ideals shaped our perceptions of political and social reality, and how have changing perceptions of reality informed our ideals in turn? These questions are fundamental to the study of normative political theory. In this course, we critically examine influential formulations of as well as responses to these questions found in the Western history of political theory. In doing so, we aim to gain a preliminary understanding of (1) the theoretical and practical significance of diverse values (such as justice, liberty, equality, and order), (2) how their meanings have changed over time, and (3) how these values have characterized conflicting political and social ideals. This course paves the way for us to formulate, justify, and strive for political and social ideals particularly suitable for the reality of our own.","Critical Thinking, Governance Systems, Political Behaviour, Political Ethics, Research Methodology","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Collaboration and leadership, Intercultural understanding and sensitivity, Ethics and social responsibility, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Legal Studies Related, AREA - PLE Core (Intake 2018 and earlier), AREA - PLE Core (Intake 2019 onwards), AREA - Political Science Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=POSC219,PLE401|POSC401,,

POSC308,SOSS,Gender Politics: Exclusion and Empowerment,"This course examines gender politics, particularly the role of women in politics.  The module begins by situating the rise of women in modern politics within the ideological struggle between patriarchy and feminism.  It aims to both clarify and problematise the concept of 'women's interests' and to better understand the causes and solutions to the pervasive problem of violence against women.  As gender is a social construct, we examine women's diversity, intersectionality and social movements as channels for collective political action.  We look at women's struggles to participate in and contribute to positions of political leadership and examine the impacts of gender quotas, critical mass, and media representations of women.

This course is concerned with the evolution of intervention in the historical norms and rules of states, with a focus on debates occurring in and around the United Nations. In addition to assessing the changing character of international society, we will consider the moral and political adequacy of existing institutions. When, if ever, is it justified to wage war against another country? To what extent should international organisations promote and encourage respect for human rights?

In this course we examine the underlying political issues that shape water management and the policies that governments make to deal with them. We will begin with domestic water issues, such as water management for food security, before turning to international water conflicts, like those brewing over the Mekong River and the Spratly Islands. In doing so, we will engage with theories of common pool resource management, policy making, and international relations.

While we often think of it in reference to middle and low income countries, development remains desirable for all people. This is because the main impetus for development – a better life – is universal.
In this class we investigate the role of politics on development. Our primary focus will be on how interests and institutions (i.e. ""political economy"") impact development.

In our everyday lives, we intuitively treat the economy as an all-encompassing yet obscure reality, as we believe its workings can be grasped only by economists who speak its specialized, technical language. We will problematize this view of the economy through a historical survey of Western social thought on central economic concepts and questions, such as property, exchange, labor, production, distribution, and consumption. This historical perspective reveals that economic problems are never purely economic but have always been entwined with political issues and ethical judgments. As we examine a range of social and political theories by situating them in their historical contexts, we will analyze how questions of power, authority, and legitimacy, and conceptions of good life have been central to various definitions of the economy. We will see that processes of production and consumption, and institutions of property and markets are invariably implicated in profound controversies about justice, fairness, freedom, and equality.

PPPM205,SOSS,Religion and Policy in Asia,"Religion is not often analysed in conjunction with public policy. Policy involves the architecture of regulation – evoking rationality and secular bureaucracy. Religion, on the other hand, is rooted in ideology and ritual, and faith in things unseen. However, religion underpins not only most societies and cultures of Asia, but is also a key element in nation-state formation and identity. It wields formidable political clout. Furthermore, policy-making on religious matters is one of the most sensitive and contested areas of governance in contemporary Asia. In this course we will explore the rise and fall of the secularization thesis and the apparent rise of religiosity as a political force. We will closely examine and complicate the relationship between religion and the state, and we will explore ways in which religion impacts policy-making in seemingly 'secular' areas such as health-care, trade, and citizenship. We will examine the role of the state in managing religious diversity and multi-culturalism, touching also on its role in enforcing religious orthodoxy. Throughout this course we will seek to develop a nuanced and grounded understanding of the interplay between religion and policy in Asia.",-,-,GRD - Graded,"AREA - Asia Studies (Intake 2019 to 2023), AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Global Asia Electives, AREA - Public Pol and Public Mgmt Electives, AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 6 ISEP; 1 SUSEP",No,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=PPPM205,,,

PSYC213,SOSS,"Work, Play, and Life","Modern societies extol busyness and may even regard work as a defining aspect of one's life. Consequently, leisure is often relegated as \""time off work\"" and sometimes leads people to construe work and leisure as opposites. This promotes the pursuit of passive and convenient leisure in contrast to their more goal-directed and effortful work activities. Unfortunately, research shows that passive leisure is not restorative nor provides important ingredients to meaningful living. In this course, we examine people's motivation to work and its reciprocal relationship with their pursuit of leisure.

In this course, we explore the infinite possibilities of using IoT to build Smart Cities Applications. 

We begin our adventure by exploring the three key components of IoT - things, connectivity, sense-making. What sensing modalities that we can equip \""things\"" with? How do we connect these \""things\"" to the Internet, and to each other? What data-driven, actionable insights could we provide to bring incredible benefits to the dwellers of smart cities? 

Drawing inspiration from case studies such as SmartBFA , we reflect deeply and broadly on the broader challenges facing Smart Cities, in particular exploring the various ways in which we could create social impact by building inclusive Smart Cities.","Design Thinking Practice, Embedded Systems Integration, Embedded Systems Interface Design, Embedded Systems Programming, System Integration","Disciplinary Knowledge, Multidisciplinary Knowledge, Interdisciplinary Knowledge, Critical thinking & problem solving, Innovation and enterprising skills, Collaboration and leadership, Communication, Understanding of sustainability issues, Self-directed learning",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business Options, AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Econ Major Rel/Econ Options, AREA - Grad Req - Dig Tech/Data Ana (Intake 2024 onwards), AREA - Smart-City Mgmt & Tech Core (Intake 2022 onwards), AREA - Social Sciences/PLE Major-related, RQCC - IS111/SMT111/CS101/COR-IS1704, RQCX - IS114, RQPR - Open to Undergraduates only",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=SMT113,,,IS114

•	What drives fashion to change and fads to occur?  
•	How can research on fashion and fad be usefully applied in the real world, from high-fashion to policy making, from marketing to economic planning? 
The major topics explored include thresholds and tipping points, contagiousness and social diseases, information cascades, social class and the origins of taste, self-fulfilling prophesies, and theories of social networks.

This course will examine trends that have shifted work away from a cradle-to-grave, steady work which predominated in the 20th century. We will also study how experiences of unemployment, underemployment, and other non-standard work impacts people in their everyday lives. This class will center on questions such as: what does work look like now, for people across social classes?; what does the absence of steady work mean for personal relationships?; how does this insecurity impact their aspirations for themselves or for their children?

SSOC202,SOSS,Overseas Project Experience (Sustainability Practices in Asia),"Innovation is essential to drive sustainability transitions, especially so in the under-considered contexts of the Global South. Sustainability transitions refer to deep systemic innovations in socio-technical and socio-economic systems for the provision of societal functions such as food, mobility, and energy (Köhler et al., 2019). The change in complex sociotechnical systems is usually confronted with conflicting economic and environmental goals, at least in certain phases of the transformation processes. By leveraging innovation, different countries in the Global South such as Indonesia can chart paths towards sustainable development that balance economic growth with environmental protection more coherently. At the same time, there has been a growing awareness in research and practice alike, that transformations to more sustainable societies can only be successful when they are inclusive. However, there are knowledge gaps in the domain of innovation for sustainability transitions (Tirado-Herreo & Fuller, 2021). Where sustainability transitions are happening, there is little data tracking progress and identifying areas/directions for accelerating sustainability transition. Addressing these knowledge gaps requires greater collaboration among different stakeholders to leverage their expertise and resources towards more effective and context-specific solutions tailored to the challenges and opportunities.

This course will allow students to focus on tackling sustainability challenges to help Asian private and public entities (the Client) to plan and strategize in pursuing sustainability transition.

While the Writing & Reasoning course, taken by most SMU students in their first year, focuses on breadth, here the students will be deepening their skills by exploring and writing about more complex issues in society and business. Students will engage with the need for deeper research, better audience analysis, and more structured writing, with a more nuanced adaptation to the context appropriate to their intended publications.
 
Students will consider and respond to meaningful real-world issues and situations in each of the three written projects. They will explore not only what other people have said about the issues that they confront, but also develop and communicate their own responses. The finished pieces will form the basis of a portfolio of written work to showcase their ability to think critically, conduct appropriate literature research, analyse their findings, argue their case, and produce professional communication outcomes. This portfolio will be a valuable addition to their resumes when they graduate. 

The final project will be an in-depth feature piece written for either Rice Media (https://www.ricemedia.co/) or the Skeptic Magazine (https://www.skeptic.org.uk/).

Rice Media, and Skeptic Magazine editors advise the students during the Week 10 presentations, and students will have the chance to have their work published by the media outlet that they write for after the term finishes.","Research Writing, Project and Proposal Writing, Audience Awareness, Critical Thinking and Writing, Argumentation and Persuasion","Disciplinary knowledge, Multidisciplinary knowledge, Critical Thinking & Problem Solving, Communication, Intercultural Understanding & Sensitivity, Ethics & Social Responsibility, Self-directed learning, Resilience",GRD - Graded,"AREA - Business-Oriented Electives, AREA - Free Electives Only, AREA - General Education, ENRL - SS Enrolment: 1 ISEP; 1 SUSEP, RQCP - WRIT001/COR1100/LAW106",Yes,https://ccms.smu.edu.sg/courses?page=1&cq=WRIT300,,,
