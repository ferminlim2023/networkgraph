The term 'back office' is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today's volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. \n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into 'intelligent accounting functions'. \n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution.

Travelling and the notion of taking a holiday were growing in popularity and a 'culture of things' primed consumerism as an expression of social status. While the abolition of slavery had begun, nationalism exploded in a Europe where Imperialism brought large parts of Asia and Africa under colonial rule and introduced new interactions, dependencies, and exploitations. \n\nArtists strove to find new ways of encapsulating this complex world through their creations. With the advent of photography and film, and new building and artistic techniques, some of the most exciting changes in art history took place. This period gave us creative universes as diverse as Monet's open-air impressions, Renoir's zest for life, Toulouse Lautrec's underground worlds, and Van Gogh's anguish. \n\nThroughout the 20th century, new sets of media and art forms appeared, and the social structure of the art world consolidated. New construction materials were used, artistic techniques developed, and a multitude of isms (Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, etc.) challenged previous conventions. Artists supported and even championed the advancement of social causes. They were often at the forefront of protest movements against wars and injustices and denouncing discrimination by race, gender and sexual orientation. Today, contemporary art simultaneously experiences greater accessibility and democratisation. At the same time, it also suffers an increasing level of commodification and continues to evolve as it finds new ways to innovate, inspire, and provoke its audiences. \n\nThis course examines crucial works of art from the nineteenth century to the contemporary. It provides students with a roadmap to reflect on them in an open-minded, critical and analytical way. It considers historical, economic and socio-political contexts, and focuses on the integration of art within the broader cultural environment.

This AI technology resembles human thinking at neural levels, but are not clear matches to how humans process knowledge. The are now adapted to process language and images, and underlie the most popular kinds of AI, such as ChatGPT and Midjourney. As such, we will focus on these types of AI.\n\nStudies of AIs' impacts from just a few years ago are already outdated due to the rise of these new AIs.

However, what are these positives and negatives, how do they combine and inter-relate, and why and how do they matter? The psychological study of subjective well-being attempts to address these questions using an evidence-based approach grounded in the scientific method and the empirical research on the constructs, causes, correlates, and consequences of SWB. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the scientific literature and psychological study of SWB.

In this class, we will explore how technological artifacts and systems— from the ships early factories to the internet—have shaped (and are shaped by) social, cultural, economic, and political factors. The course's underlying premise is that \"technology\"—a concept that carries a multifaceted ideological baggage—only makes sense when understood as being embedded in specific social, material, and ideological configurations. That is to say, there are histories of technologies. Instead of a comprehensive survey, the course will unfold through chronologically arranged topics that include the emergence of industrial society, imperial mobility, urban spectacles, systems of mass production, gendered consumption, digital cultures, risk in the Anthropocene, and technological imaginings. The unifying theme weaving all these topics together will be that far from being deterministic, technology is instead better understood as a site of contestation and negotiation for different visions of society. So that students can dig deeper into those tensions, each week will feature not only scholarly readings, but also two primary source-driven case studies in which groups will explore the complex intersection between technology and society—including Singaporean rickshaws, the Magnitogorsk Soviet industrial city, the contraceptive pill, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. For their final project, students will select a technological artifact and write a historical essay about its development and/or use.", "group": 6}, {"id": "COR2219", "name": "Heated Debates: Climate Justice", "subject": "COR", "code": "COR2219", "level": 2, "description": "This course is aimed at anyone who wants to gain an understanding of climate change, the moral problems it raises, and the responsibilities we have, individually and collectively, because of it.

Game theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with strategic interactions: situations where the benefits and costs of each agent or actor depends not just on her actions but also on the actions chosen by other agents. Many problems of global concern, like climate change, the use of artificial intelligence, pandemics, and great power conflicts, are characterized by the tension between self-interest and cooperation, miscommunication, and misalignment of incentives. Game theory is a powerful and incisive tool to analyse these issues because it has been used extensively to address collective-action challenges, which are at the heart of most game-theoretical applications in the social sciences; moreover, solutions to these challenges must account for information manipulation and unintended consequences, which are core game theory concepts.  Collective-action problems are situations where the objectives of the whole society or collective are best served if its members take a particular action or actions; however, as these actions are costly, and one can free-ride on others' actions, individuals are disincentivized from cooperating. To solve these problems, game theory looks at how the strategic interaction among members can be improved to generate cooperation.  This course is designed for non-economics majors who want an accessible but also comprehensive and challenging introduction to the game-theoretic tools and principles essential for understanding the nature and possible solutions to collective-action problems without taking a standard game theory course.

Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require a fundamental transformation of the global economy, particularly in the energy and hard-to-abate sectors that contribute the most to global emissions. This transition demands significant investment, estimated at US$3-4 trillion per year, necessitating substantial scaling and deployment of both private and public sector capital.\n\nThis course delves into decarbonisation pathways and key climate transition strategies within the energy and hard-to-abate sectors, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to assess credible transition planning and articulate key decarbonisation challenges and growth opportunities in the emergence of new clean technologies. The course also highlights the wider policy landscape and how significant government policies can influence the development of low-carbon products and their supply chains. Additionally, it explores various funding structures to finance companies' decarbonisation strategies, the meaning of sustainable business, and the need for companies to transition in a financially sustainable manner.\n\nBy the end of this course, students will understand the challenges and opportunities associated with reducing carbon emissions in traditionally difficult-to-decarbonise sectors such as cement, steel, fossil fuel energy, and transport. They will gain foundational knowledge necessary for finance professionals to assess the viability and impact of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. Students will learn about the technical processes and commercial viability of decarbonisation technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels like hydrogen, as well as geographical considerations, national circumstances, and geopolitical factors. The course will also cover the role of international cooperation, government policies, and private sector initiatives in driving decarbonisation. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to contribute to the development and implementation of effective decarbonisation strategies, fostering a low-carbon future for Asia's most challenging sectors.\n\nThe course is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. This includes analysis of viable pathways to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, focusing on the energy and hard-to-abate sectors; exploration of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels; examination of significant government policies and their impact on the development of low-carbon products and supply chains; an overview of different funding mechanisms to support decarbonisation efforts; discussion on the importance of financially sustainable transitions for businesses; and practical examples and case studies to illustrate successful decarbonisation strategies and initiatives.

The study of organised crime in Asia has stimulated empirical investigations into a diversity of phenomena including the racialisation of criminals, supply chain organisation of illegal goods and services, corruption of legitimate actors and institutions, white collar criminality, and issues related to legislative frameworks and law enforcment efforts. Although the core subject is crime, efforts to understand, control, and eradicate organised crime in Asia has never been a uniquely criminological or even uniquely sociological endeavor. Instead of a monopoly by any single discipline, research into the field of organised crime in Asia has attracted scholars with diverse academic backgrounds including, psychology, economics, history, law and political science.\n\nThis course systematically charts and analyses the multidisciplinary dimensions of the study of organised crime in Asia, by drawing on scientific research done in the field of psychology, sociology, economics, political science, criminology, and cultural studies. Drawing on case study analysis of organised crime in Asia, metaphorical and substantive references to its interdisciplinary dimension will be highlighted on five levels of observation: the individual \"organised criminal\", the activities these individuals are involved in, the associational patterns through which they are connected, the power structures that subordinate these individuals and collectives to common or particular interests, and the relations between these individuals, structures and activities on the one hand, and the legal spheres of society on the other. Subsequently, the course will highlight the advantages and critique the limitations of a multidisciplinary analysis of organised crime in Asia. In general, the study of organised crime has profited from an multidisciplinary approach. In these cases, concepts and theories have been adopted either on the assumption that organised crime is a facet of a larger phenomenon under investigation in other disciplines, or on the assumption that sufficient similarities exist between organised crime and the objects of study of other disciplines in order to permit the drawing of analogies. However, it is equally important to address the caveat that unless the borrowing of eclectic oncepts and theories from a variety of academic disciplines is strategically done to build up a cumulative body of knowledge, efforts to conceptualise, theorise, and police the complex phenomenon of organised crime in Asia will be compromised rather than facilitated.", "group": 35}, {"id": "HUMN021", "name": "Religions in Asia", "subject": "HUMN", "code": "HUMN021", "level": 0, "description": "Globalization — the swiftness of modern transportation and the speed of information transfer — has made our world borderless.

Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations.

While manual labors still take some part in those systems, some other parts become more and more automated by artificial intelligence (AI). In general, we might expect that those systems treat users fairly. If the system uses AI that is built on big data and complex algorithms, such expectation would be strengthened. Compared to human labor that might involve subjective decision-making, algorithmic systems are expected to objectively work and treat users fairly. However, in recent years, there are raising concerns about the potential harms of those systems, which are rooted in biases embedded in socio-technical systems. The inherent opaque nature of AI systems makes the problem worse.\nFor example, YouTube recommends next videos when a video is finished playing. Those recommendations, on the one hand, are helpful to find interesting videos from a tremendous number of YouTube videos, but on the other hand, it is often unclear how or why the video is recommended. What happens if some biases exist in the recommendation algorithm, such as favoring videos with a specific (political) view? No matter whether those biases are intentional or unintentional, users would be exposed to a certain set of videos and are likely to be influenced by them.  \nYouTube is only one out of many examples because AI systems are becoming pervasive these days. In various areas, including healthcare, hiring, financial service, ads, policymaking, and internet services, AI systems are actively used. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that those systems are working fairly without any potential biases. It might be overlooked that the biases are embedded not only in the AI systems but also in established processes or human operators within the systems.\nThe goal of this course is to provide students with an extensive understanding of diverse concepts of fairness and bias in socio-technical systems through examples across diverse domains, from healthcare to internet search.

New economies are formed, such as from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the development of 'cognitive services', the digitization of goods and the provision of storage/sharing and management services. Governments, including the Singapore public sector, are also aware of the importance of data to governance and to the future of the economy and are driving innovations and technology usage within that sector as well as in society generally through the Smart Nation initiative and Digital Economy drive.

After becoming familiar with the insolvency regime existing in some relevant jurisdictions, we will analyse which factors and insolvency provisions may help create an optimal insolvency regime. In order to do so, we will take into account the economic problems that insolvency law seeks to solve, the particular features of a country, and the impact that the solutions provided by insolvency legislators may have on entrepreneurship, innovation, and access to finance. It will be shown that insolvency law is a very powerful tool to promote growth in a country. For this reason, linked to the fact that many jurisdictions want to become global centres for corporate restructurings, several countries around the globe are amending their insolvency laws. Among other proposals, we will analyse those existing in the United States and Europe, and which steps are being taken by Singapore to become a global leader for corporate reorganizations.

Knowledge about the key areas of commercial laws in the two largest economies in the world will get students better prepared for cross-border transaction practices. At the same time, these two jurisdictions are also chosen for their distinctive characters in their legal and regulatory frameworks. The corporate and securities laws in China reflect a mixture of its civil law tradition, British law influence through Hong Kong, and American law impact as a result of the bulk of Chinese scholars and regulators studying in the U.S..  On the other hand, despite its common law heritage, the U.S. corporate and securities laws have developed along a unique track due to competition among states and unparalleled depth of its capital market. The topics to be discussed are chosen mainly from the Chinese perspective, with their functional equivalents in the U.S. law are compared. The purpose of the course is threefold.  First, we will learn the basic rules of corporate and securities laws in China and the U.S.. Second, we will understand the social and economic rationales underlying the different rules and practices in these two jurisdictions. Finally, using law as a gateway, we will explore some important business and financial activities in the world's two largest economies.", "group": 42}, {"id": "LAW4026", "name": "Critical Topics in Chinese Commercial Law", "subject": "LAW", "code": "LAW4026", "level": 4, "description": "This course aims to introduce students to the six critical commercial law topics in China.

It is a unique oppor-tunity to learn more about consulting services and apply theoretical knowledge to a real business project. The core focus of this class rests on a group work built around a real world business project offered by one of our corpo-rarte partners. For each session (G1 and G2), we are collaborating with more than twelve different corporate partners with each student group benefitting from an exclusive relationship to their own corporate partner. The corporate projects cover different industries and different topics. Students are invited to share their preferences with which corporate partner (and thereby in which industry or on what topic focus) they wish to work and gain experience. \n\nThis SMU-X course is a combination of advanced in-class learning and practical interaction with the business world via project work and guest lecturers who work/have worked with major consultancy companies such as McKinsey, BCG, or Bain. The lectures introduce the world of consulting by teaching the basic steps and tools used during the consulting process. You will learn how consultants frame, analyse and solve problems and how they present their solutions to their clients. You will obtain tools and frameworks to reduce complexity and structure a project. Sev-eral mini cases and lived situations with your corporate partner will help you to develop an understanding of how to approach a business project and manage the relationship with your corporate partner as a client. Guest lectures will provide you with industry insights and hands-on experiences about the day-to-day business of a consultant.\n\nThe unique opportunity to explore, learn, and directly apply competencies in a real life, multidisciplinary, team-based consulting experience with a company/organization is the distinguishing feature of this course. You will be working in teams for (large) corporations or smaller startups, acting as student consultants working on real challenges the organizations presently face. The solutions you develop will be presented to the senior management of the compa-nies. In previous semesters, our corporate partners included DBS (banking), Adidas (sports apparel), WWF (nature conservancy), Nestlé (nutrition), SingPost (logistics), Lufthansa (airline), CapitaLand (real estate), Sygnum (fintech), Lazada (E-commerce) and many more.", "group": 44}, {"id": "MGMT237", "name": "Corporate Strategy", "subject": "MGMT", "code": "MGMT237", "level": 2, "description": "This builds on the course 'Strategy'.  Corporate strategy is the pattern of decision-making that determines a firm's goals and objectives, produces principal policies, defines the range of business to pursue, and pertains to the overall plan for a diversified firm.  A firm's corporate strategy acts as both a catalyst for and a constraint on the strategies of its business units.  If the business strategies do not support the firm's corporate strategy, synergy becomes impossible.  Therefore, this progression reinforces the inextricable link between business strategy and corporate strategy, with cases of business integration, strategic alliances, corporate diversification, and mergers and acquisitions.  Drawing on these factors, the major objective of this course is to help student to understand: 1) conditions under which different types of corporate strategy have the potential to create (economic and social) value, competitive and corporate advantages; and 2) organizational and managerial systems that must be in place in order to realize this potential value creation.", "group": 44}, {"id": "MGMT238", "name": "Strategic Leadership in Business", "subject": "MGMT", "code": "MGMT238", "level": 2, "description": "Strategic leadership of a firm has shown to make a significant impact on business performance, yet this is an often overlooked area by business leaders today.

We will examine individual leaders (What can we learn in contrasting the leadership of Apple vs. Samsung?), leadership teams (What composition of a top management team works best when comparing companies such as Petronas and BP?), and board composition (What can we learn from the governance structures of Yahoo! and Google?). Whether it is a Fortune 100 company or a small start-up, the individual executives, top management teams, and the governing bodies (board of directors) make an impact on the outcomes of the firm.

Sustainability practitioners must not only help develop (i.e., design) and sell a sustainable product or service, but an entire mind-set, and where necessary, to devise changes in business models and operations. The course will guide students, working in teams, through a development process involving market and strategic assessment, positioning of the product (including its sustainability attributes), customer-centric design, and business model innovation. This will in turn lead students to develop value propositions and marketing, which will be presented in a final pitch session to the client's representatives. The primary methodology will consist of design thinking techniques, which will be broadly used and adapted to the sustainability context. Phases of design include the understanding of candidate consumers' (users') needs by qualitative means, creation of basic product concepts and prototypes, and the testing and validation of prototypes with users. Implications will also be drawn for the client's business model. Note that the course may be more time-intensive than a content-based or normal SMU-X course, as it centers on a project with a methodology (design thinking), but also involves content on sustainability and business, and involves some use of analytical techniques such as secondary market research (e.g. assembling of data on consumer segment numbers).

While Malaysia's 2024 GDP per capita (purchasing power parity) of US$34,072 places it as the third richest country in Southeast Asia, its digital economy is its most dynamic growth engine. The country's prime industries include manufacturing, oil and gas, and services, but it is the rapid expansion of the digital sector that presents significant opportunities. These growth opportunities align perfectly with a focus on online retail:•\tExplosive growth in e-commerce: Malaysia's e-commerce market is projected to reach US$8.79 billion in 2025, driven by a growing preference for online shopping and an increase in smartphone and internet penetration. Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2030) of 7.54%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$12.64bn by 2030.•\tExpansion of online retail beyond the Klang Valley: There is a major opportunity to increase regional market penetration and brand visibility by expanding online order fulfillment across West Malaysia to cities like Ipoh, Penang, and Johor.•\tDevelopment of digital and social commerce: The rise of live-stream selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Shopee Live, and Lazada Live offers a direct channel to reach a wider, younger, and more digitally engaged audience, driving immediate conversions and building customer relationships.Malaysia is well-positioned to take advantage of these growth opportunities and become a leader in the ASEAN digital economy.In addition to the traditional industries, Malaysia has a flourishing digital economy. The country is home to a number of start-ups and tech companies and is attracting significant foreign investment, particularly in the e- commerce and fintech sectors.

Indonesia, the largest and most geographically widespread, in 1945 was the first to become independent.  Formed in 1948, the Federation of Malaya became independent in 1957.  The city state of Singapore broke off from Malaya and became independent in 1965.  At this point, these three post-colonial countries were at somewhat similar levels of development (although the British had treated Singapore as an urban center and a major port -- not an agricultural resource).  All three were low income countries with per capita GDP ranging from $56 in Indonesia, $333 in Malaysia to $516 in Singapore.  Indonesia and Malaysia possessed significant natural resources, whereas Singapore (now cut off from Malaysia) was bereft even of water.  Over the past fifty years, the political and economic choices made in the three countries have varied, and their growth trajectories diverged.  Today, per capita GDP varies greatly:  Indonesia, $3,491; Malaysia, $11,307; and Singapore, $56,284 (World Bank data).\n\nThese three countries have pursued different pathways which to some extent can be explained by economic drivers, but also by government policy choices with regard to inclusive growth.  The course will consider this in the context of business in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, and will study it from multiple perspectives:  government, corporate/family business, and social impact. To examine this in a one-week timeframe, we will focus on the development of infrastructure, real estate (housing), education and health care.\n \nResource-rich environments attract investors, but managing today in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia where governments are sensitive to issues of competitive and strategic sustainability, raises challenges.  Having moved from low income status to low middle-middle income status, Indonesia and Malaysia face the challenge of avoiding the \"middle-income trap,\" the situation where developing economies' convergence to the development frontier comes to a halt once their income per capita reaches a middle-income level.

First, the specific historical form of the global economy under study is \"capitalism,\" understood as not only an economic system of material production, distribution, and consumption but also a political order of power, authority, and legitimacy – in other words, a global political economy. Second, in analysing capitalism, we adopt a long historical view that traces the emergence of its fundamental logics and global expanse back to the eighteenth century. Third, we pay special attention to political and legal frameworks other than the nation-state, especially early-modern colonial empires, modern imperialism, and their institutional and ideological legacies that have endured into the post-war international regimes of production, trade, and development.\n\nThe aim is to provide a perspective on the political and historical dimensions of the global economy that is as multi-disciplinary as possible.
